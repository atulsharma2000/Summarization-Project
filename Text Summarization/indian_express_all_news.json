        "content": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is conducting raids at 15 premises, including that of businessman and Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra, besides various other places in Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh in connection with the pornography case against Kundra.\nSources in the agency said the places being searched include Kundra’s residence in Juhu and premises linked to hisassociates.\nIn May 2022, the central agency registered a money laundering case against Raj Kundra in connection with the pornography case. The case was registered based on an FIR against him by the Mumbai police in 2021 for allegedly running a pornography racket. Kundra had been arrested by the Mumbai police in this connection. The ED is probing the financial transactions pertaining to the case.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe police made the first arrests in the alleged porn racket case in February 2021. Prior to this, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch conducted raids at a bungalow in Madh Island where porn movies were allegedly being shot.\nKundra was arrested in July 2021 after investigations revealed that he was a key conspirator in the case. The pornographic content produced was being distributed over subscription-based mobile apps like HotHit Movies and Hotshots.\nThe Hotshots app was developed by Armsprime Media Private Limited, a firm founded by Kundra in 2019. Armsprime later sold Hotshots to Kenrin Limited, a UK-based firm owned by Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi.\nThe Mumbai police have already filed a chargesheet against Kundra and three other accused linked to the case. In 2021, Kundra spent two months in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail and was granted bail in September that year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe ED is looking into significant overseas transactions in this connection. The agency is already investigating a money laundering case against Kundra over a Bitcoin scheme.\nIn April this year, the agency provisionally attached immovable and movable properties worth Rs 97.79 crore belonging to Kundra, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the Bitcoin investment fraud case.\nThe central agency said the attached properties include a residential flat in Mumbai’s upscale Juhu area, which is currently in the name of Shilpa Shetty, a residential bungalow situated in Pune, and equity shares in Kundra’s name.\nThe ED filed the Bitcoin money laundering case against Kundra based on multiple FIRs registered by the police forces in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Pvt Ltd, Amit Bhardwaj (deceased), Ajay Bhardwaj, Vivek Bhardwaj, Simpy Bhardwaj, Mahender Bhardwaj, and several multiple-level marketing (MLM) agents.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe FIRs alleged the accused had collected huge funds in the form of Bitcoins – reportedly worth Rs 6,600 crore in 2017 — from people with false promises of a 10 per cent monthly return in the form of Bitcoins. “The collected Bitcoins were supposed to be utilised for Bitcoin mining and investors were supposed to get huge returns in crypto assets. But the promoters cheated the investors and have been concealing the ill-gotten Bitcoins in obscure online wallets,” the ED had stated.\nIn November 2023, Kundra made a movie ‘Undertrial 69 aka UT 69′ based on his days in prison, playing the central role himself."

        "content": "When 58-year-old Leelavati received a message from Khoda police station in Ghaziabad on Tuesday, telling her they had found her son, she wasn’t too excited.\nOver the last 31 years, she has received over seven such calls from the police, only to return disappointed. Her son Bhim Singh was nine, she says, when he was kidnapped in broad daylight. “I thought it would be a repeat of what happened many times earlier,’’ she recalls. “The police will bring a man in front of me and ask me to identify if he is my son. Every time they called me, I told them (policemen) about the marks on my son’s body. The marks never matched and I would return disappointed.”\nHowever, a small spark of hope remained. “I hardly had any hope of reuniting with my missing son… but then I kept telling myself, ‘what if they had found him?,’’ she says. “I had to go.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nInside Khoda police station, Leelavati covered her head with her blue saree as soon as a man appeared. “He looked at me and shouted… this is my mother,’’ she recalls.\n“I was a bit surprised and didn’t believe him. But when he called me mother again, I was moved to tears,’’ she says. There was another surprise for her though. She gave the policemen details of the marks on her missing son’s body and when they checked, her description matched. “He was indeed my son”.\nBhim is now a grown man. He is 40.\nThe tragic tale of this family, staying in a single-room house on the terrace of a two-storeyed building in Gali no. 6 of Ghaziabad’s Shaheed Nagar, began on September 8, 1993. Bhim, then around 9 years old, was returning from DBS Public school along with his two older sisters, Rajo and Santosh.\nBhim remembers that day vividly. “I remember asking my sister, Rajo, to buy me an umbrella while we were on our way back home. She didn’t want to and we were arguing,’’ he recalls. “Suddenly, a few men encircled me. They picked me up, pushed me into an auto (rickshaw) and drove away”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor Santosh (45) and Rajo (43), that moment is etched in their memory. “He was wearing a white shirt and light blue trousers. We were minutes away from our home, when a group of unknown men took him away,” recalls Santosh.\nAt that time, Rajo and Santosh were 14 and 12 years old respectively. Bhim also had a younger sister, Hema, who was less than a year old at the time. The sisters say they ran back to their home and informed their mother.\n“Their eyes were red. They were shivering and all they said was some people had taken Bhim in an auto. I ran barefoot to the spot. Their father was not home. I kept looking for him the entire day,” recalls Leelavati. “It was an unending trauma… we kept looking for him.”\nAfter 31 years, two months and 19 days, the family was miraculously reunited.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The last time I went to the police station three years ago. That time too my son wasn’t there. But I never lost hope. I knew he would find us one day,” says Leelavati\nWhile Bhim was missing, a lot changed — both his grandparents died, two of his sister got married. “My in-laws had left to go back to their village, Baidpura in Dadri, a year after he was kidnapped. His grandfather died 10 years ago and three years later his grandmother also died,” says Leelavati. “Two of his sisters are already married. We have become old now.”\nIt was Bhim’s younger sister Hema who saw a picture resembling her elder brother in a local daily on September 22. “It was an article about a man who had been missing for a long time and the police were searching for his family to reunite them,’’ Hema says. A relative, who works as a constable in the Ghaziabad Police, asked the family to visit the police station.\nAt Khoda police station –Bhim had already been taken to six different police stations before this — he also recognised his sisters the moment he saw them.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Besides, he had a mole on his right leg, a mark on left ear, a cut mark on his forehead and his hollow shaped head,” Leelavati says.\nBhim’s father, 70-year-old Tularam, however, wants to convince himself further. “We know he is our son. But we will get the DNA test done after December 6 to be sure about it,” he says.\nThe Ghaziabad police had been approaching the family because Bhim’s father had filed a missing person complaint at Mohan Nagar police station on September 9, 1993, a day after the boy was kidnapped. This case was unresolved.\nTwo days after Bhim was kidnapped, the family says, they had received a ransom letter. “We got a letter and his kidnappers demanded Rs 8 lakhs to set him free,” Tula Ram says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile the family was frantically looking for him, Bhim says his nightmare began the moment he was kidnapped. “After taking me away in the auto, the kidnappers subsequently put me in a truck and drove away,’’ he says. The kidnappers, he says, had taken him to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. “Before I could do anything, they chained me outside a hut of a herder,’’ he recalls. “They would make me rear sheep and cows…. milk them… during the day but they would keep me chained at night so that I couldn’t run away”.\nWhen asked if he ever made any attempts to run away, Bhim says he couldn’t.\n“I did not know where to go. For 30 to 40 km around the place, I knew there was no road. People travelled in camel carts. How far could I go on foot?” he says.\nBhim says that his “owner” was a man named Sai Ram who “kept an eye on me all the time”.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Once, a sheep had become so weak that it was not able to stand and died. They beat me badly.. they broke my right hand. My jaw got dislocated, I was scared of them,” he says.\nHow did he escape?\n“A few days ago, I met a truck driver while I was grazing sheep in the afternoon in Jaisalmer,” he says. “I narrated my entire story to him. He rescued me. He wrote all the information that I remembered on a piece of paper. This finally helped me reach Ghaziabad,’’ Bhim recalls. This note mentioned his name, his father’s name and that he is from somewhere in Ghaziabad.\n“The driver dropped me off at a market somewhere in Delhi. From there, with the help of people, I reached Indirapuram Police station in Ghaziabad,” Bhim says.\nHe says that initially he cried a lot. “But now my tears have dried up. I can’t cry anymore.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe says that he always missed his sisters while living in that desert far away. ”We would always play together in the house. I used to hate the fact that Happo would always get more milk to drink,” he smiles.\nBhim had given his own nickname, Happo, to his younger sister Hema – then just a newly born.\nThe sisters say while Bhim was missing, every Raksha Bandhan they would tie a Rakhi to his photo, which was clicked when Bhim was 6 years old.\nBhim, the Ghaziabad Police says, was rescued by a truck driver. “He found him somewhere in Jaisalmer. Bhim narrated the entire incident to the truck driver. This truck driver wrote his information on a paper and helped him reach the police,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ghaziabad, Nimish Patil says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBhim had reached Ghaziabad on November 22. For the next five days, he was taken to several police stations where families of missing children came to check. He had met three other families earlier but had categorically said they are not his family.\n“It is a miracle,’’ Bhim’s father Tularam says. “We are going to teach him to use a mobile phone first and ask him to continue his education. He was in class three then, now he will start studying again.”"

        "content": "The historic nature of Maharashtra’s Assembly results might be more visible if we set aside the dramatic numbers and surprising turn-around from the Lok Sabha outcome. No doubt, the numbers are daunting — winning 132 seats out of the less than 150 contested, or pushing the rivals 14 percentage points backward, are no mean feats. But let us look at the major shifts this result will bring about.\nIf one starts tracing the history of how Congress lost control over states, Maharashtra will be one of the last ones. Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka came out of Congress dominance in the early 1980s. At that time, Congress in Maharashtra was still in the saddle, though the dominance had almost become dilapidated by then. The party went on to win 1985 handsomely and 1990 with hiccups. In a sense, this state was “the last fortress of Congress dominance” (to borrow the title of a book by Palshikar and Rajeshwari Deshpande, 2020).\nSubscribe to read on\nSelect your plan\nBEST VALUE\nAll-Access\nAd-lite experience\nAccess to premium stories\nAccess to ePaper\nSubscribe for ₹3.5/day\nDigital Only\nAd-lite experience\nAccess to premium stories\nAccess to ePaper\nSubscribe for ₹2.5/day\nAlready a subscriber?

        "content": "A large jewellery exhibition in Mumbai becomes the site of a heist. A hysterical phone call raises alarm, gunfire is heard, the cops on duty herd the panicked gathering into a secluded area, and during the melee, a fistful of precious gems go missing.\nChief investigator Jaswinder Singh (Jimmy Shergill) zeroes in on three suspects. Long-time employee at a jewellery store Mangesh Desai (Mehta), his pretty colleague Kamini (Tamannaah Bhatia), and computer techie Sikandar Sharma (Avinash Tiwary) who is in a tearing hurry to leave the grounds once the all-clear is sounded. The more Jaswinder hounds them, the more they stick to their stand of having nothing to do with the robbery. Do they protest too much? Or are they truly innocent, proving Jaswinder with his vaunted ‘instinct’ wrong, marring his blameless record for catching every single thief he has encountered?\nAlso read – Crew movie review: Kareena Kapoor, Tabu, Kriti Sanon’s easy-breezy comedy washes away stench of recent Bollywood duds\nADVERTISEMENT\nNeeraj Pandey has pulled off quite a heist with his new film in which he shares writing credits with Vipul K Rawal. The ‘heeron ki chori’ is just a lead-in to a film which is more pulpy character study than out-and-out thriller, a rare beast in Bollywood. The two-hour plus duration is dotted with twists and turns you don’t see coming, even as the whodunit-howdunit suspense keeps simmering: there are things I did twig on to, but the surprises kept coming, making things enjoyable.\nThat said, there are contrivances and plot-holes aplenty, and a few characters aren’t developed as much as they should have, but given the genre, you are willing to take them in your stride. Because the moment you are ripe for an eye-roll, something unexpected happens, and your attention is diverted, which is exactly what the filmmakers want.\nThe film swings through a fifteen year arc, from 2009 when the heist occurred, to the present when the mystery is sought to be unravelled through a series of flashbacks. How an event such as this can impact lives, and take them into unanticipated directions is woven through the telling, and the characters look and feel older, just as they should, even though some of the make-up looks plastered on.\nThe ensemble is the key to keep us watching. Jaswinder’s career has taken a dive, but his obsessive beliefs remain unshaken, a trait that has seen him part ways with his partner (Dutta, in a small role, leaves a big impact), and Shergill plays his character with the right degree of worn conviction. Tamannaah Bhatia proves that she doesn’t need only dance numbers in horror comedies to get eyeballs: she can be ‘stree’ enough. For a change, Rajeev Mehta gets more than just a forgettable role on the side. And Avinash Tiwary, flying high on his successful re-release of ‘Laila Majnu’, is, as ever, a delight.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRead more – Chor Nikal Ke Bhaaga movie review: There’s a lot going on in Yami Gautam, Sunny Kaushal film\nBeing on OTT means you can junk big stars in the pursuit of good story-telling. Or that’s what it was supposed to mean, before the streamers also got sucked into vacuous starry propositions with zero results. ‘Sikandar Ka Muqadaar’, its title riffing off on one of Amitabh Bachchan’s late 70s blockbusters, is a solid example of how you can get a film going on the strength of plot and performance, with stars servicing the story, just the way it should be.\nSikandar Ka Muqaddar\nDirector – Neeraj Pandey\nCast – Avinash Tiwary, Jimmy Shergill, Tamannaah Bhatia, Rajeev Mehta, Ridhima Pandit, Divya Dutta, Ashrut Jain\nRating – 3/5"

        "content": "The Telangana IAS Officers’ Institute and the Telangana IPS Officers’ Association have condemned remarks made by Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) working president and MLA from Sircilla, K T Rama Rao, against Rajanna Sircilla District Collector Sandeep Kumar Jha.\nOn November 26, Rao had accused the District Collector of behaving like a Congress worker and urging BRS activists to join Congress.\n“The District Collector is working as a Congress party worker. Don’t be afraid of such people. Even Chief Minister Revanth Reddy cannot do anything to BRS. District Collectors and other officers who are working as Congress activists would be taught a good lesson when BRS returns to power,” Rao had said while addressing party workers in his home constituency.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It is disturbing to note that it is becoming a norm to cast aspersions on public servants by persons occupying responsible public offices,” the IAS Officers’ Institute said in a statement.\nThe Telangana IAS Officers’ Association also expressed “deep concern and strong condemnation regarding the recent derogatory statement” by Rao.\n“In an unfortunate public remark, the collector was personally targeted and belittled in a manner that undermines the dignity of the officer holding such an important position in the state’s administration and Civil Services at large. We demand that such statements are retracted and an apology for the unwarranted remarks made,” the statement said.\nThe Association said that Rao’s comments questioned Jha’s integrity and impartiality. “The Association calls for immediate cessation of such unfounded accusations and urges all stakeholders to engage in discourse that respects institutional integrity and the rule of law,” it said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKTR, who was a minister when the BRS was in power, has had several run-ins with the ruling Congress since the latter stormed to power in November 2023.\nEarlier this month, Rao alleged that Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy’s brother-in-law was awarded contracts worth over Rs 1,000 crore under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) despite his company lacking the necessary qualifications."

        "content": "The Congress on Friday raised with the Election Commission “serious and grave inconsistencies” which it said were being revealed in the data relating to the polling and counting processes for the recently-concluded Maharashtra Assembly polls and sought an in-person hearing to present relevant evidence.\nIn a memorandum to the poll panel, AICC Maharashtra in-charge Ramesh Chennithala, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole and AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik said “these glaring inconsistencies” which strike at the very root of a transparent, free and fair electoral system are not based on any biased motives or far-fetched presumptions but have been extracted from the information made publicly available by the Commission.\nSharing the memorandum on X, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the leaders have raised serious issues which are being discussed in the public domain. They have asked the Election Commission (EC) for an in-person hearing to present the relevant evidence and raise constituency-wise issues as well, he said.\nHere is a memorandum just submitted to @ECISVEEP on the Maharashtra assembly elections by Shri @NANA_PATOLE, Shri @MukulWasnik, and Shri Ramesh @chennithala\nThey have raised serious issues which are being discussed in the public domain. They have asked the EC for an in-person… pic.twitter.com/K4zfx5tjhF\n— Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) November 29, 2024\nIn their memorandum, the Congress leaders said, “In fact, questions relating to Maharashtra’s voter data have also been raised by a former Chief Election Commissioner, hence we are bringing the same to the attention of this Commission.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThey flagged two issues of arbitrary deletion of voters and subsequent addition of over 10,000 voters in each constituency from the final voter lists as well as inexplicable increase in voting percentages from 5 pm to the final voter percentage declared by the Commission at 11:30 pm on the day of polling on November 20.\n“In the days leading upto the polling day, the Indian National Congress (INC) and its allies received several on ground-level reports about different means being adopted by the ruling regime to commit large scale electoral fraud across the Assembly Constituencies in Maharashtra,” the memorandum said.\n“With this exercise of unchecked and arbitrary deletion and consequent insertion of voters, the state of Maharashtra witnessed an unprecedented increase of an estimated 47 lakh voters being added to the electoral roll from between July 2024 — November 2024,” the memorandum said.\nIt is significant to note that out of the 50 Assembly constituencies where there was an average increase of 50,000 voters, the ruling regime and its allies secured victory from 47 of these constituencies, the leaders argued.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“These data points on a prima facie reading, demonstrates that — there has been a significant and inexplicable increase in the number of registered voters across the state of Maharashtra; and there has been an exercise of deletion and addition of names in voters lists; all of which have conveniently worked to the advantage of the incumbent government,” the memorandum said.\nThis issue was duly raised by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance on October 19 before this Commission, he said.\n“However, no cogent action was taken by this Commission on the Representation dated 19.10.2024 submitted by the MVA Alliance in this regard,” the memorandum said.\nThey urged the Commission to immediately undertake a thorough investigation and prepare a detailed report on the addition and deletion of voters in Maharashtra.\nElaborating on the other issue, the Congress leaders said several glaring discrepancies have been reported in the voter turn out data for the Maharashtra Assembly elections.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPointing out that as per the data made available by this Commission, the polling percentage across the state of Maharashtra at 5 pm was 58.22%, they said the percentage was later reported to be 65.02% as of 11:30 pm on the same day.\nIn fact, it is pertinent to place reliance on the statements by former Chief Election Commissioner of India SY Qureshi, who has gone on record to state that the voter data that is made available on the date of polling is recorded and updated in real time, therefore, there is no logical explanation of what has transpired in Maharashtra, the Congress leaders said.\nThe manner in which genuine doubts have arisen in the minds of the electorate regarding the conduct of free and fair elections, it is imperative that this Commission provides a clear response justifying the inconsistencies and the discrepancies which have been reported both prior to the elections and post elections, they said.\n“We would also request that this Commission grant us an urgent in-person hearing to raise all our issues in detail. In fact, apart from the two issues mentioned herein, there are several other constituency specific issues which we would like to raise before this Commission,” the Congress leaders said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe BJP-led Mahayuti alliance scripted a powerful comeback in the state assembly elections by winning 230 seats in the 288-member House.\nRecovering from its Lok Sabha elections losses, the BJP bagged 132 constituencies, the highest among all constituents of the Mahayuti. Shinde’s Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar’s NCP also performed well. The Shiv Sena won 57 seats while the NCP won 41 seats.\nThe Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered a setback. The grand old party registered one of its worst performances in the state assembly polls after it won only 16 seats. Sharad Pawar’s NCP(SP) won just 10 seats, whereas Uddhav Thackeray’s (UBT) won 20 seats"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/jnu-sexual-harassment-complaints-data-reveals-9697130/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has recorded 151 sexual harassment complaints since 2017, the year its Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) replaced Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Harassment (GSCASH), according to data obtained through an RTI application.\nThe university claims to have resolved nearly 98 per cent of these complaints, with only three cases currently under investigation.\nHowever, when asked about the nature of the complaints and the action taken against the accused, JNU refused to provide information, citing confidentiality.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe decision to dismantle GSCASH in 2017 has been a contentious issue, with the JNU Students’ Union and Teachers’ Association consistently demanding its reinstatement.\nThe association argue that the ICC lacks the transparency and autonomy that GSCASH provided and operates under administrative influence, undermining trust in its processes.\nThe data shows that the highest number of cases in a single year was reported in 2018-19, with 63 complaints. Before the ICC’s formation, JNU had received 38 record cases in 2016.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic years saw a significant drop, with only six complaints registered between 2019 and 2021, likely due to reduced campus activity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, the numbers surged in recent years, with 30 complaints each in 2022-23 and 2023-24.\nSeventeen cases were registered in 2017-18, 63 in 2018-19, five in 2019-20, one in 2020-21 and five in 2021-22, the data showed.\nIn 2015, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) noted that JNU had the highest number of sexual harassment complaints among the city’s educational institutions with 51 cases reported in a span of three years between 2013 and 2015. It amounted to approximately 50 per cent of such complaints among Delhi’s educational institutions during that period.\nRecently, several cases have brought JNU under intense scrutiny.\nIn April, a second year female student staged an indefinite strike for 12 consecutive days on campus blocking the main entrance point of the varsity after alleged ‘inaction’ over her ‘sexual harassment’ complaint to the university officials. The survivor and the supporters were later penalised by the varsity for staging the protest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn October, as many as 47 female students filed a joint complaint with the ICC regarding alleged sexual harassment and violence that occurred during a freshers’ party on campus.\nSimilarly, in April, JNUSU claimed a female student of Centre for Chinese and South-East Asian Studies at the varsity was sexually harassed by her professor and inaction by the varsity administration over her complaint forced her to leave the campus.\nThe incidents have led to widespread protests and raised questions about the handling of complaints by the ICC."

I think he does that instinctively, and it’s not a long run-up, but I can see he’s reviewed that ball, and then he’s planning the next one.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGlenn Maxwell ha rated Jasprit Bumrah as the complete package as a bowler. (Reuters)\nRecalling Bumrah’s slower ball to Shaun Marsh at the cusp of Lunch Break in Melbourne Test during the 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy,” Fleming said: “There’s that famous dismissal of Shaun Marsh at the MCG in 2018]in the over before lunch. I was commentating at the time, and I could almost pick what was going to happen, just driving him back, so his weight’s on the back foot, and then he bowls that superb slower ball and knocks him over.\n“It was either going to be that slower ball or a fast yorker. So I think he is so astute, but he also now has all the skills—outswingers, inswingers, off-cutters, slower balls, excellent yorker, bouncer.\nICC Latest Test Ranking: Jasprit Bumrah has regained the No. 1 spot in the ICC Test bowling rankings after spearheading his team to a record 295-run win over Australia. (AP)\n“So when you’ve got more skills, you’ve got more options. Like the Terminator, he’s always stalking the batsmen. And the batsmen know that, but they’re still unsure what’s coming. Not only does he have a wide skill set, but he executes it better than anyone in world cricket.”\nIndia will take on Australia in the Pink-ball Test in Adelaide starting December 6."

        "content": "Does Thursday’s Durban mania elevate Marco Jansen’s pedigree in the international bowling space as a menacing, unplayable beast when at his best?\nAll-time batting lows have been the flavour of late in Test cricket. Sri Lanka’s precipitous collapse for 42 all out at Kingsmead also impressed that Jansen can be as good a rhythm bowler as any, even if he may not have channelled the consistency factor yet. The 6-foot-9 left-armer’s 7-for may have passed on memories of Mohammed Siraj’s Lanka dahan last year.\nJansen, though, is getting steadier even if his latest haul might not be his most skilful work. The seven-wicket sequence comprising three bowled, one caught-and-bowled, and one caught at first, second and third slip each, would rank as a significant numerical hallmark. It also prompted Jansen’s compatriot Rassie van der Dussen, who last played a Test in 2022, to write on social media: “South Africa is the toughest place to bat in Test cricket. Change my mind.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen leaves the field as he holds the ball after taking seven wickets during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)\nFast 7\nJansen’s incredible burst packed Sri Lanka for 42 in only 13.5 overs (83 balls), making it the second shortest completed Test innings in history and the lowest in 100 years since South Africa’s capitulation in England in June 1924 (30 all out in 7.5 overs).\nThe innings also marked the fourth sub-50 total for visiting teams in South Africa, the most for any country in the 21st century. Jansen picked up his first off his eighth delivery. 33 balls later, he was leading his side off the field with the best figures (7/13) by a South African pacer this century.\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen, left, celebrates with teammates after Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka’s out for 3 runs during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, (AP)\nJansen’s spell was the joint-quickest in deliveries to reach seven wickets by a bowler in an innings, matching Hugh Trumble’s 41-ball 7-fer for Australia in the Ashes in 1904. He may not have dismayed the opposition quite like Curtly Ambrose during his famous 7/1 sequence in Perth (he was 0/24 before scalping his first wicket), but Jansen’s 7/9 (excluding extras) will also rank among the best Test bowling sequences for anyone who’s picked as many in an innings. Fourth-best by a pacer, in fact, and the fastest since Ambrose’s WACA massacre in February 1993.\nBest recorded 7-wicket Test sequences by pacers\n7/9 – (25 balls) Monty Noble 7/17 – Aus v Eng, 1901/02\n7/2 – (28 balls): George Lohmann 8/7 – Eng v SA, 1895/96\n7/1 – (30 balls) Sarfraz Nawaz 9/86 – Pak v Aus, 1978/79*\n7/1 – (32 balls): Curtly Ambrose 7/25 -WI v Aus, 1992/93\n7/9 – (33 balls): Marco Jansen 7/13 – SA v SL, 2024*\n• – excluding wide, no-balls\nLevelling up with Steyn, Rabada\nWhile consistency can almost instantly pull Jansen to the top seam-bowling bracket today, his fledgling career is far from middling, jostling between good and great. The 24-year-old went past 50 wickets with the seven-for in his 23rd innings, moving up to 56 scalps with a 20.17 average. That puts him on par with South Africa’s four-best pacers this century. His teammate Kagiso Rabada, north of 300 scalps, reached 50 in his 22nd innings. Jansen drew level with SA’s highest-wicket taker, the legendary Dale Steyn who got his 50th in his 23rd innings. He ranks ahead of Morne Morkel and Makhaya Ntini, who got theirs in 29 and 32 innings respectively.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKagiso Rabada in action\nThe strike rates are holding pretty well – Jansen’s 36.08 is the second-best of all time (min. 2000 balls bowled). He would, however, be modest about it in the company of Rabada, who boasts an astounding 38.47 SR for his 314 wickets. So quite fairly, the coast is clear for Jansen to tap greatness. It helps one way when countrymen like van der Dussen, openly admit to the batting challenge in their backyard.\nJansen and South Africa’s best this century\nPlayer\nInnings to reach 50 Test WKTs\nWKTS after corresponding match\nCareer wickets\nCareer SR\nCareer Average\nVernon Philander\n13\n51\n224\n50.8\n22.32\nKagiso Rabada\n22\n58\n314*\n38.4\n21.46\nMarco Jansen\n23\n56*\n56*\n36\n20.17\nDale Steyn\n23\n51\n439\n42.3\n22.95\nMorne Morkel\n29\n53\n309\n53.3\n27.65\nMakhaya Ntini\n32\n54\n364\n52.7\n28.93\nBatting deathbeds\nThe numbers have dwindled considerably in South Africa, with the country being the harshest on batters outside the spin quagmire in India. Since the inception of the World Test Championship, batters have averaged 25.50 per wicket in South Africa across 16 Tests, bettered marginally by batting in India at 27.97.\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen, right, with teammates leaves the field as he holds the ball after taking seven wickets during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa. (AP)\nVisiting top-order batting (1-4) averages have collapsed to 27.35 in this period, considerably lower from the overalls of 32.93 in 251 Tests. The middle-order (5-8) runs have been vital in this time for travelling units, with as many centuries (4) coming from their bats as the top four – only five runs separating the two sets of batters on average.\nThe spicy decks can also backfire on the hosts, like when India pulled off a seven-wicket win in Cape Town earlier this year in the shortest-completed Test, with an outright result in 106 overs. As Jansen and Rabada will likely breathe more fire before New Year (two Tests each vs SL and Pak lined up), the only glaring deterrent in South Africa’s quest for reaching their maiden WTC final is going to be their own wavering willows.\nADVERTISEMENT\nJansen bowling sequence: 0, 0, 0, Wd, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 0, 1, 0, Nb, 0, W, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, W"

        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron will visit renovation works at Paris’ Notre-Dame cathedral on Friday (November 29) ahead of its reopening on December 7, five and a half years after a devastating fire destroyed its roof and spire and caused major damage throughout.\nHere is what you need to know:\nWhat is Notre-Dame?\nA medieval Gothic masterpiece, Notre-Dame de Paris (Our Lady of Paris) is one of the French capital’s most beloved and visited monuments. Its rib vaulting, flying buttresses, stunning stained-glass windows and carved stone gargoyles have long been celebrated in books and movies.\nThe first stone was laid in 1163, and construction continued for much of the next century, with major restoration and additions made in the 17th and 18th century.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVictor Hugo used the cathedral as a setting for his 1831 novel, “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame”. Quasimodo, the main character, has been portrayed by Hollywood actors including Charles Laughton and also in an animated Disney adaptation.\nWhy and how did it burn?\nOn the evening of April 15, 2019, the cathedral’s roof burst into flames. Soon, the fire had engulfed the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Around the world, TV viewers watched with horror as the medieval building burned. The roof collapsed but the bell towers and facade held. It remains unclear what exactly caused the fire. French authorities have said an electrical fault or a burning cigarette may have been responsible.\nWhat will happen at the opening ceremony?\nPresident Emmanuel Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral on December 7 after which Paris’ Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will use his crozier to knock on the cathedral’s heavy doors.\nFrom within the cathedral, a psalm will be sung three times in response to the knocking, after which the doors will open. The archbishop will bless the cathedral’s ancient organ before it starts playing. This will be followed by a service.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso in Explained | Notre-Dame – architectural marvel and most important witness of French history\nThe service is invitation-only and the guest list is not yet known. It will be followed by a show broadcast from the cathedral square, for which details are also not yet available.\nHow was the cathedral rebuilt?\nMoney poured in from all over the world, including from French luxury sector billionaires Francois Henri Pinault and the Arnault family. So much money has been donated – more than 840 million euros ($882 million), according to Macron’s office – that there will even be funds left over for further investment in the building. The damage has needed five years’ worth of restoration work.\nWhat has changed?\nOfficials say the cathedral will be more beautiful than ever, not only because the spire, roof and anything else destroyed by the fire was rebuilt by thousands of expert craftspeople, but also because the stone and paintings, which had blackened over the years, have been thoroughly cleaned. The furniture was also renovated and cleaned, or replaced.\nNot everything was damaged in the fire. For instance, emergency workers formed a human chain to whisk gem-studded chalices and other priceless artefacts out of harm’s way."

Raghu became synonymous with loud outburts and foul-mouthed rants as a judge on the show, leading his future mother-in-law to become concerned about giving her daughter away to him. In an interview, Raghu said that he has shed that version of himself, which he has named ‘Roadies Raghu’. Comparing his alter-ego to the Incredible Hulk and calling himself Bruce Banner, Raghu said that he would never consider doing Roadies again because he cannot put himself through that turmoil.\nAppearing on the Unfiltered with AminJaz podcast, he said, “I know that people have an expectation from me that I get very worked up. That was true. But a lot happened in my life that changed me. I’m not the guy that you’ve seen, at all. I call him Roadies Raghu. He was amazing. There was a reason he was born, and that reason was justified. But later, it became unmanageable. I couldn’t live with it, so I had to let him go.”\nAlso read – Raghu Ram says divorce ‘nearly killed’ him, reveals wife Natalie’s family objected to their marriage: ‘He’s the most abusive man in India’\nADVERTISEMENT\nRaghu continued, “In my life, there have been ups and downs.

No politics. All these things really f**k me up. When people say that I should do Roadies auditions again, I say, ‘I would rather nail my d**k to a burning building than put myself through that again.”\nElaborating more about Roadies Raghu, he said, “When he comes out, it’s entertaining for everybody. But you have to understand, he’s Hulk, I’m Bruce Banner. He comes and goes, leaving me to pick up the pieces of the devastation that he’s left behind. I’m talking about him in the third person not because I’m a megalomaniac, but because I’ve had to dissociate myself from him.”\nAsked what his relationship with his alter-ego is, Raghu said, “I love that person. The reason he was there is because he protected me. He protected me at a time when I couldn’t. He expressed when I couldn’t. I’m an introvert, and I’m a non-confrontational guy. In my relationship, there is no argument that has ever happened. I don’t do it. This guy is confrontational. He picks fights. He’s like a bull in a china shop. I have to realise that he’s an aspect of my personality that is not me. I have no control over him. I love him because he protects me, but I have to keep my distance from him.”\nIn the same interview, Raghu Ram also opened up about his experiences on the show, and why he eventually quit. He said that as Roadies became more popular, the channel tried to make him do things that he wasn’t comfortable doing."

        "content": "Alarming as it may sound, children are spending unprecedented amounts of time online. Young ones are often navigating unfiltered virtual worlds. A recent UNICEF report claims that over 175,000 children log onto the internet for the first time each day—essentially one every 30 seconds. Although this endless stream of connectivity offers education and entertainment, it also puts them at serious risk. \nA recent study by AIIMS Bhopal revealed that as many as 33.1 per cent of teenagers are struggling with depression and 24.9 per cent are battling anxiety in Madhya Pradesh. The study indicates a larger pattern, calling for more attention and supervision from parents. This makes it all the more important for parents to understand the risks and proactively adopt e-safety measures to keep their children safe in this hyper-connected world.\nConsidering the numerous threats faced by children online—be it on social media platforms or through online games—we attempt to tackle this pressing issue head-on. This article is the result of insights gathered from an online safety expert, a child psychologist, and a clinical psychologist.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInternet risks for children and teenagers:\nFrom cyberbullying to online predators, the virtual world is replete with bad actors and harmful content, even exposing them to privacy breaches. While they may not seem hazardous to the unsuspecting minds, their consequences can be perilous. Addressing them is critical, and here is a look at the kinds of risks young children are exposed to as highlighted by experts:\nCyberbullying: It refers to online harassment or abuse with the use of digital technologies. Cyberbullying can occur on social media, messaging apps and games. It is often a repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring or shaming those who are targeted. Kids can be an easy target of online bullies.\nExposure to harmful content: Content that is not age appropriate such as hate speech, violence, and pornography.\nOnline sexual exploitation: Offenders contacting potential victims through social networking sites is one of the traps kids can easily fall into. Grooming is the process during which a child sexual offender draws a child in by gaining his or her trust to sexually abuse the child and maintain secrecy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDisinformation: Encountering false or misleading information or manipulated content online.\nPrivacy breaches: Unauthorised access to personal data of children shared online.\nOnline frauds and scams: Falling for fake apps selling popular children’s products at low prices along with spending money or being tricked through gaming applications.\nFinancial and physical threats: Increased risks due to AI, deepfakes, and other emerging technologies can lead kids to financial and physical threats.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Ami Kumar, online security expert and founder of Social & Media Matters, “grooming, financial scams, and deepfake threats are among the most common and serious online risks for children.” Social & Media Matters is an organization working for child online safety for the past decade.\nICYMI | Are you safe on public Wi-Fi? What you need to know now\nOnline harm is not limited to fraud and scams; another persisting issue is the excessive screen time among children. Unchecked screen time can affect their mental and physical well-being, such as poor quality of sleep, strain on eyes, and reduced physical activity. This can also lead to an impact on cognitive development, social skills, and emotional well-being, making it all the more vital to manage screen time among children.\nScreen time guidelines according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics:\nTo help parents navigate the challenge of online safety, the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) provides screen time guidelines tailored to different age groups:\n\n📌Children below the age of two should not be exposed to any type of screen with the exception of occasional video calls with relatives.\n\n📌Screen time for children between the ages of two and five years should not exceed an hour; the lesser, the better, under parental guidance, monitoring what the children are watching.\n\n📌For older children and adolescents, it is important to balance screen time with other activities required for overall development. These activities include an hour of physical activity (playtime), adequate duration of sleep (recommended sleep time varies with age; for example, adolescents require eight to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep at night), and time for schoolwork, meals, hobbies, and family time. If any of these activities is disrupted due to screen use, then it can be termed excessive screen time, and efforts should be made to reduce it.\nWhat experts say\nDr Jaya Shivalkar, child and adolescent psychologist and developmental paediatrician, said, “The impact of screen time on a child depends on their age. Children aged seven-eight are in a crucial developmental phase, and extended exposure to screens can hinder social and oral development, leading to anxiety, introverted behaviour, and even school phobia.” \nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Shivalkar, another major concern is the increasing disconnect with reality as they delve more into fantasy. “For children over 10, basic learning skills are affected, and compulsive behaviour can develop, resulting in aggression. By adolescence, such behaviours often escalate into addiction. Physically, issues like obesity and deteriorating eyesight are also common concerns.”\nWhile awareness is key, experts suggest that parents need not instill fear in children about the internet. (Image: FreePik)\nMoreover, being exposed to inappropriate content at a young age can be detrimental to their overall development. “Exposure to inappropriate content online can have a variety of consequences. Children and adolescents may experience anxiety and fear. It is common to see graphics or hate-based content that aren’t censored online and that can cause a lot of fear,” said Sharmishtha Hardas, a clinical psychologist. \nHardas feels that the use of social media can also set unrealistic standards of beauty and lead to comparison and lowered self-esteem. “In severe cases, body dissatisfaction can lead to eating disorders and body dysmorphia,” she said.\nHow can parents identify the warning signs?\nAccording to experts, the following are the warning signs that can help parents identify if their children are in trouble:\nADVERTISEMENT\nBehavioural changes: Changes such as becoming unusually quiet or aggressive; requesting more money, privacy, or alone time; avoiding age-appropriate activities like going out, eating with family, or playing; displaying irritability, aggression, or abusive behaviour when gadgets are taken away are some behavioural changes parents spot.\nEmotional indicators: Mood swings or being unusually secretive can be one of the major emotional indicators, social withdrawal or isolation and even decline in academic performance can be usual warning signs for parents.\nPhysical and routine changes: Spending more time on mobile phones, often secretly, sleep disturbances or complaints of headaches can also be considered as primary warning signs.\nGeneral observation: Any noticeable change in a child’s behavior typically has a reason, and in today’s context, it often stems from online activity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRole of communication between parents and kids:\nShivalkar believes that parents should become role models for kids. “Parents should set good examples. If they use their smartphones all the time, then they cannot talk to kids about their ill effects. There is a need for conscious parenting. And, parents must be more alert, educated, and aware than the kids,” she said. “Parents should encourage kids to indulge in alternative hobbies such as arts and sports.”\n“Parents need to develop the art of holding conversations while keeping their child’s comfort in mind. These conversations need not be limited to online safety but can also include topics like sexuality, drug use, and education,” says Kumar. The online safety expert asserts that before giving a child access to a device or Wi-Fi network, parents should understand its purpose and be informed about the apps their child uses.\nAlso Read | Is your child addicted to smartphones? Psychologist shares 7 reasons to be concerned\n“Avoid installing apps unless you know what they do, who uses them, and the type of interactions they allow. Simply following trends is unsafe. A quick search, such as the app’s name followed by ‘child safety,’ can provide useful details about the app and its security features. Once your child is online, engage them in conversations about their activities—for example, ask what games they play or how things are going,” said Kumar, adding that the earlier parents intervene, less harm is likely to occur.\n“For kids under 8 years of age, the conversations should be around what they see on the internet, teaching them not to share personal details online, and avoiding interactions with strangers. For pre-teens, the discussion should focus on the significance of privacy settings on apps, digital footprint, and the importance of avoiding inappropriate content,” said Hardas. \nADVERTISEMENT\nCommunication is key to keeping your child safe online. (Image: FreePik)\nHardas says recognising cyberbullying, reporting it and informing parents should be encouraged among children. She emphasised that there is no need to instill fear in their children about the internet.\nWhat about a child’s privacy?\nIn an ideal world, parents should respect their child’s privacy online. However, this respect should be balanced with appropriate guidance and supervision to ensure they are safe.\nKumar strongly feels that respecting a child’s privacy is a foreign concept created by big tech companies. “A child’s privacy can be secondary to their safety. Till the age of 18, it is parents, school, and society that are responsible for the child’s safety,” he said, highlighting that it is completely on the parent to keep their child safe.\nShivalkar too feels that parents are afraid to infiltrate the privacy of their kids. But up to 18 years, all screen content needs to be monitored by parents. On the other hand, Kumar notes that parental controls are effective. \nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Your smartphone is frying your brain: Neuroscientist explains how increased screen time is impacting our lives\n“Most platforms and apps have the option of parental controls. Parents can also find multiple options to customise the online experience. Instagram has recently launched a new feature where algorithms can be completely reset; this makes sure young ones are only seeing content that is entertaining, educating, and fun for them, and none of the harmful content comes into their timeline if they are using their parents’ phone,” said Kumar. \nWhere to seek help?\nExperts always mention that parents should seek help the moment they feel that something is off, but from where and how are questions. Shivalkar offers a simple answer, “Pediatricians where your kids go since they are born is where you take them once you notice warning signs. Pediatricians all over the country are constantly trained to deal with these issues. And taking children to them is less of a task, since they are accustomed to the visit from their childhood.\nCan parents seek help from schools?\nYes, experts suggest that schools can be approached for further help. “In certain cases, children tend to follow things taught in school more and hence parents should ask for awareness activities from school in cases of online safety, schools can play a better role,” Shivalkar said.\n“Schools play a very important role, education and capacity building should come from schools. Parents need to make sure that children are made aware of online safety through schools,” Ami said. \nGeneral guidelines for parents:\nExperts recommend the following tips to help parents keep their children safe online:\n📌Practise open and unbiased communication with your children.\n📌Follow screen time guidelines recommended by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics.\n📌Be firm in saying “no” to gadgets, even if children use emotional tactics.\n📌Lead by example and limit your gadget use at home.\n📌Watch for early signs of screen addiction.\n📌Seek help from a pediatrician or child psychologist if needed."

        "content": "Australia batter Steve Smith has lauded pacer Jasprit Bumrah and his “unorthodox bowling action” and “exceptional skill-set.”\nBumrah bagged eight wickets in the Perth Test match, including a five-wicket haul in the first innings, and helped his side to a 295-run victory. India’s stand-in skipper for the first Test was also adjudged player of the match for his performance.\n“From the start of his run-up, it’s just all awkward,” Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The way he runs in is different to pretty much anyone else, then the last bit of his action is different. I’ve faced him a reasonable amount now, and each time you face him it takes a few balls just to get the rhythm of it in a way.”\nFormer Australia captain Smith explained how Bumrah’s release point is at least a foot closer to the batters than any other bowler making it that much difficult to pick the length.\n“He releases the ball closer to you than any other bowler, just the way he does it. So maybe it rushes you a bit more than you think, and it’s just an awkward action,” said Smith, who was trapped by Bumrah for a duck in the first innings.\n“Put that together with his skill set—he swings it both ways, he can nip it off the seam, he can reverse it, got a good slower ball, a good bouncer—he’s pretty much the complete package as a bowler.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIndia will next face Australia in the Pink-ball Test in Adelaide starting December 6."

        "content": "Sorgavaasal Movie Review: Prison films are tough to crack, but the allure of this genre is understandable. It is essentially a chamber drama where every character is unpredictable, and the audience is tuned to expect them to get violent at any time. These characters are ticking time bombs, and the setting allows the writers to explore the human psyche and deliver a solid character-driven drama. With this base in place, one can add the required flavours like romance, sentiment, revenge, and even comedy, and a prison film will have the space for it all. What really matters is the proportion of each, and for the longest time in Sorgavaasal, debutant director Sidharth Vishwanath, along with his co-writers Tamizh Prabha and Ashwin Ravichandran, get it right. However, despite perfectly building a Virumaandi meets Vada Chennai narrative to a crescendo, they falter at the end. But the characters, and its effective portrayal, ensure Sorgavaasal escapes without crashing and burning. \nSorgavaasal opens with jailer Kattabomman (Karunaas) saying this was a job he didn’t want to do. It is a job that neither helps him gain respect nor make money with bribes. Then, he lets us know that given a choice between being a servant in heaven and a king in hell, many of us would choose the latter. And who is he telling all of this to? It is investigating officer Ismail (Natty), who is trying to understand the machinations of a bloody prison riot that ended with 45 deaths, and 60 reported missing cases. Through this investigation, we are introduced to the various guards of this not-so-pearly gates of ‘heaven’. \nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta, whose petition asking for a survey of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah was admitted by a local court on Wednesday, runs an organisation that has in the past been linked to the defacement of signboards in the national capital, holding a havan for Donald Trump’s victory, the assault of Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, and the targeting of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s Delhi residence.\nOn Wednesday, the court issued notices to the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Archaeological Survey of India, and the Ajmer Dargah Committee, and listed the matter for December 20.\nGupta, 40, was born in Etah, Uttar Pradesh, and moved to Delhi at a young age. He joined the Shiv Sena’s youth wing as a student, and became part of the Bajrang Dal in 2008.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 2011, he and some others founded the Hindu Sena, an organisation that he claims has “lakhs of members” now, with units in “almost all parts of India”.\nOn its website, the Hindu Sena says it “aims to oppose the Islamisation in any form, Sharia law implementation, love jihad and Islamic extremism in India”, and that it would “highlight and protest and take legal action against any person/entity causing harm to the sovereignty of India and Sanatana Dharma”.\nHis petition in Ajmer is the not the first time he or his outfit have knocked on the court’s doors. In 2022, a Bench led by the then Supreme Court Judge, Justice D Y Chandrachud, rejected an intervention application filed by Gupta in May that year, seeking dismissal of the petition filed by Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Management Committee, which had challenged the videographic survey of the Gyanvapi Mosque complex in Varanasi.\nIn February 2023, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and M M Sundresh dismissed a petition by the Hindu Sena seeking a ban on the BBC for its documentary on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the 2002 Gujarat riots, calling it “completely misconceived”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn April 2024, the Delhi High Court rejected a petition filed by the Hindu Sena seeking the removal of Arvind Kejriwal from the post of Chief Minister following his arrest.\nHe and his outfit have also faced several police cases. Asked about these, Gupta said, “I don’t know how many FIRs have been lodged against me. Ab koi chor batayega humne kitni chori kari hai? (Will a thief tell you how much he has stolen?).”\nIn October 2011, an FIR was lodged against Gupta and BJP’s Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga for allegedly assaulting Bhushan at his chamber in the court. Gupta was subsequently arrested by the Delhi Police. In October 2015, he was arrested for allegedly giving false information about beef being served at Delhi’s Kerala House.\nIn June 2017, an FIR was lodged against Gupta and Hindu Sena members, allegedly for barging into the CPM headquarters in Delhi and manhandling party general secretary Sitaram Yechury.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn November 2020, a case was lodged against Gupta following a complaint by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation for allegedly defacing the signboard of the India Islamic Cultural Centre and pasting a poster that read Jihadi Terrorist Islamic Centre.\nIn September 2021, five members of Hindu Sena were arrested for allegedly vandalising the residence of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi.\nIn June 2022, the Hindu Sena allegedly organised an event at Vishwagiri temple in Rajouri Garden and held a “sword distribution” in support of Nupur Sharma following her suspension by the BJP for alleged objectionable comments on the Prophet. A complaint was filed before the National Commission for Minorities.\nIn August 2023, the Delhi Police stopped a mahapanchyat organised by the Hindu Sena, including Gupta, at Jantar Mantar for alleged inflammatory speeches with references to communal violence in Haryana’s Nuh.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe and his outfit have also been in the news for allegedly defacing the signboards of Akbar Road and Feroz Shah Road in Delhi; vandalising the office of Pakistan International Airlines; protesting the then Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Pakistan in 2016; organising a havan to ensure the victory of Trump in the presidential election the same year; amd throwing ink on J&K MLA Engineer Rashid in 2021."

        "content": "The Uttar Pradesh government’s plan to put up posters with photographs of more than 100 protesters allegedly involved in the Sambhal violence on November 24 is not the first time the Yogi Adityanath administration has considered naming and shaming people accused of damaging public properties during protesters.\nThe government first responded in this manner in the aftermath of the widespread protests in the state against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in 2020. On March 6, 2020, the UP government put up posters at major crossings in Lucknow containing the names, photographs, and addresses of 57 anti-CAA protesters identified through CCTV and other visuals. Among those shown in the posters were leading activists, including Congress leader Sadaf Jafar, Rihai Manch founder Mohammad Shoaib and Deepak Kabir, prominent Shia cleric Kalbe Sadiq’s son Kalbe Sibtain Noori, and retired IPS officer and activist S R Darapuri.\nThe accused were asked to pay compensation for allegedly damaging public properties during the protests. The government sought to recover Rs 1.55 crore from these protesters and warned them that their properties would be seized if they failed to pay up.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThree days later, the Allahabad High Court took suo motu cognizance of the incident and asked the Lucknow administration to remove the hoardings of those booked in cases of alleged vandalism, calling it an interference in their privacy.\nThe court listed the matter for hearing on March 16 but before that, the UP government moved the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court. The Supreme Court observed there was no law to support the government’s action but did not pass any interim order. Moving swiftly, the Adityanath government decided to come up with its own law to lay down the procedure to punish those guilty of damaging public property.\nOn March 15, the government issued an Ordinance to define the procedure and punishment in such cases and soon it was promulgated into the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Act, 2020, which the state Assembly passed in August.\nWith the matter still pending in courts, posters with the photos and details of the anti-CAA protesters came up again in public places on November 6. These posters declared them as absconders and announced a Rs 5,000 reward for information about them. These accused were booked under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn July 2021, the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition filed by one Parwaiz Arif Titu seeking to quash these notices, directed the UP government not to take action on earlier notices sent to the protesters for recovery of damages. In compliance, the government in February 2022 withdrew 274 recovery notices that were issued before it passed the new law on recovery of damages and assured that it would look into the matter as per the new law. Now, as per the new law, cases of recovery of damages are heard by a claims tribunal."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ug-students-courses-adp-edp-duration-9697014/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "Undergraduate students will soon have flexibility in completing their programmes in less or more time than the standard three or four years, following a recent decision by the University Grants Commission (UGC).\nWhether students opt for an ‘accelerated’ or ‘extended’ timeline, they will earn the same degree as those on the standard track, provided they fulfil all academic requirements. Higher education institutions can offer these options starting with the 2025-26 academic session.\nHere’s what the programmes might look like and how they could benefit students.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat are ‘Accelerated Degree Programmes’ (ADPs) and ‘Extended Degree Programmes’ (EDPs)?\nAt the end of the first or second semester, but not beyond, undergraduate students will be allowed to opt for an ADP or an EDP. Students enrolled under an ADP will follow the same curriculum and must earn the same number of credits as required for a three- or four-year UG programme. However, they can complete their programme sooner by earning additional credits starting from the semester they choose the ADP.\nUnder this scheme, a three-year UG programme can be completed in five semesters instead of the standard six (shortened by a maximum of one semester), while a four-year UG programme can be completed in six or seven semesters (shortened by a maximum of two semesters) rather than eight.\nOn the other hand, students who choose the EDP will be allowed to earn fewer credits per semester compared to the standard programme, allowing them to take longer to complete their course. Their course duration can be extended by a maximum of two semesters.\nWhat is the objective behind ADP and EDP, and who may benefit from it?\nUGC Chairman M Jagadesh Kumar said the National Credit Framework allows students to complete UG courses in accelerated or extended programmes to accommodate “diverse academic needs and cognitive abilities”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nExplained | First phase of ‘One Nation One Subscription’ approved: How the scheme can improve govt institutions’ access to journals\n“ADP allows high-performing students to complete their degrees faster by earning additional credits and allowing them to enter the workforce or pursue higher studies sooner. Conversely, EDP supports students who face academic challenges by offering them an extended timeline to complete their degrees at a manageable pace. Together, these options promote equity, ensuring all learners have the means to achieve their educational goals,” he added.\nHow will they be implemented?\nThe UGC’s recently approved Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) calls for higher education institutions to set up a committee to scrutinise the applications they receive for ADP and EDP at the end of the first or second semester and select students accordingly. According to the SOP, the committee will evaluate the “credit-completing potential” of the student based on their performance in the first or second semester. An institution can earmark up to 10% of the sanctioned intake for ADP students.\nOn the SOP not having such a cap for the number of EDP students, Kumar said: “Students with weaker academic performance often require more time to understand and apply concepts. EDP enables them to take fewer credits per semester, allowing them to focus intensely on each course without the stress of heavy workloads. This is why we have not kept any upper limit for EDP.”\nThe committee will also decide the minimum number of credits a student must earn in each semester under the ADP and the EDP, considering the UGC’s Curriculum and Credit Framework for Undergraduate Programmes.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWill the exams or degrees be any different from standard ones?\nThe exams will remain the same as standard three- or four-year UG programmes. The SOP says that government departments, private organisations, and recruiting agencies should treat ADP and EDP degrees on par with degrees completed in the standard duration. It adds that the degree should contain a note that states that the academic requirements for a standard programme have been completed in a shorter or extended duration.\nAlso Read | India’s National Education Policy, 2020, explained\nKumar said: “ADP and EDP apply to both three-year UG programmes or four-year UG programmes with honours/honours with research. For students opting for either ADP or EDP, earning the total credits required in a standard four-year UG Programme with honours/honours with research would qualify for an Honours degree.”\nWhen will the options kick in and how will institutions prepare?\nADVERTISEMENT\nKumar said higher education institutions can start offering ADP or EDP from the July-August session in the 2025-26 academic year. It would be up to the institutions to decide whether they would like to offer these programmes.\n“Institutions can offer courses in online or hybrid modes, leveraging the UGC’s approval for up to 40% of courses being delivered online. This will allow students in ADP or EDP to take additional or fewer credits at their own pace without disrupting regular class schedules. Additional classes can be scheduled outside standard hours to accommodate ADP students. This option benefits students who want face-to-face interactions but have a compressed timeline,” Kumar said.\nHe added: “ADP students can enrol in advanced or specialised courses already part of postgraduate or advanced undergraduate curricula, allowing them to fulfil credit requirements more efficiently. Micro-credentials can be introduced, enabling students to accumulate credits at their convenience. These can include skill-based programs that align with degree requirements. Higher education institutions could introduce an inter-semester term (e.g., summer or winter) where ADP students can take additional courses. This would not interfere with the regular semester structure. Students can take electives or core courses from different departments to flexibly manage their credits.”"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-military-clampdown-may-not-keep-imran-khan-down-9696790/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "Early on Wednesday morning, protestors belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were beaten into retreat from Islamabad after several days of clashes with military and paramilitary authorities. While verified figures are still awaited, several eye-witness accounts report the use of live ammunition late on Tuesday night,-early Wednesday morning, resulting in at least eight deaths. These events mark the fourth major confrontation between government authorities and the PTI in the last six months, centred on the issue of ex-PM Imran Khan’s continued incarceration and ongoing crackdowns against his party across the country.\nRights violations and heavy coercion against the PTI characterise an ongoing phase of political instability, which can be traced back to at least April 2022, following a breakdown of relations between the military and Khan, and the latter’s ouster from government and eventual arrest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSince then, the military’s domination of executive affairs has only grown via another civilian face — a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz led government featuring Shehbaz Sharif as PM — put in place through a heavily compromised general election in February this year. Earlier this month, the ruling regime further tightened its hold on state affairs through a constitutional amendment that transferred control of judicial appointments and bench selection to the executive.\nExpress View | Pakistan’s political crisis: No winners of face-off\nWith PTI having been violently coerced off the streets of Islamabad, Khan still under arrest, and the constitutional amendment still in place, the ruling regime appears to have won the latest round.\nImmediate post-mortem of the aborted protest reveals three issues. The first was a miscalculation of the extent to which the government would use violent means to disperse protestors once they had entered Islamabad. Excessive, life-endangering violence, sees periodic use in Pakistan’s so-called peripheries of the tribal districts and Balochistan, but is rarely deployed as a crowd-control method in the heartland, let alone the federal capital. The unexpected escalation in state violence, on the pretext of the security of visiting Belarusian President, and the ensuing panic brought the sit-in to a bloody end.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe second was leadership indecision. The protests were simultaneously led by Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the PTI-ruled Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, and Bushra Bibi, the incarcerated ex-PM’s wife. At various points, the convoys appeared to be moving at different speeds, and insider accounts now report there were internal disagreements within the leadership and between the leaders and protestors on the final destination. These were perhaps best captured in a short video clip where PTI protestors can be seen urging a visibly frazzled Gandapur to stay the course and pick up speed.\nThird, the bulk of the mobilisation came south to the capital from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa relatively unencumbered, with the expectation that reinforcements traveling north from Punjab would arrive. That part never materialised. Pre-emptive measures taken by the government to arrest party activists and lock down entry and exit points of all major urban centers, such as Lahore, severely constrained mobility across the province. The provincial leadership in Punjab, too, seemed less enthused by the prospect of a prolonged sit-in.\nRead more | US mission in Pakistan issues security alert, advises Americans to avoid Peshawar hotel\nWhile the government chalks this down as a victory, and the PTI reflects on its internal troubles, the underlying factors driving episodic instability in the political sphere remain in place. A coerced calm in Islamabad simply cannot paper over the fact that the current ruling arrangement is plagued by an absence of popular legitimacy. February’s election, which birthed the current parliament and resulted in a PMLN-led central government, was compromised by the denial of franchise to PTI voters, the incarceration of its candidates, and the manipulation of polling-day outcomes.\nThese polls happened in the midst of Pakistan’s worst cost-of-living crisis in recent history, with inflation rates well above 20 per cent, and the economy teetering on the brink of default. While macroeconomic indicators have stabilised in recent months, the wholesale erosion of real wages and living standards since late 2021 remains fresh in people’s memory.\nThe government’s proclamation of economic stability rests on a current account surplus and growing dollar reserves does little to assuage the violence inflicted on common households by an average growth rate of less than 2 per cent over these past three years. However, seeing the current wave of popular discontentment as a mere spasmodic response to economic distress would be doing an analytical disservice. No amount of violent curtailment or internal disarray can deny the entrenched ideational popularity of Imran Khan and his party.\nIn the past decade, the PTI has risen head and shoulders above all other parties to cultivate an informational ecosystem with unprecedented reach and penetration across the country. It draws on Islam-inflected imagery and narrations, Khan’s personal appeal as a political (and even spiritual) leader, and a consistent portrayal of politics as an existential fight against a corrupt cabal (that since 2022 also features the military high command). All of it disseminated through viral TikToks, WhatsApp forwards, and Facebook videos to vast swathes of a population fully immersed in the digital realm.\nMOST READ\n1\nThe JEE system is broken.

Reminiscent of domestic politics the world over, Pakistan’s traditional parties, like the PMLN and PPP, are struggling to expand their support base against a populist upsurge, taking refuge instead in dynastic control and sclerotic distribution of patronage to key constituents, such as a delegitimised mainstream media. This strategy offers rapidly diminishing returns, at best.\nBut perhaps most crucially, Pakistan’s military high command is in the throes of a crisis of public appeal due to its turn against Khan in 2022. Its conventional core support base among the urban middle class of Punjab now firmly leads PTI’s oppositional charge, leaving scant access to alternative sources of legitimacy. In this configuration, stability in the political sphere can only be enforced through coercion. And it seems that will remain the dominant order of the day in the months to come.\nThe writer teaches politics and sociology at the Gurmani School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), in Lahore, Pakistan"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/rajya-sabha-seat-scramble-ticker-in-haryana-bjp-9696407/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "Intense lobbying has started in Haryana BJP after the Election Commission (EC) announced that a bypoll for a Rajya Sabha seat will be held on December 20.\nThe bypoll has been necessitated by the resignation of Krishan Lal Panwar who was elected to the Assembly and subsequently became a Cabinet Minister in the Nayab Singh Saini government. Now the vacant seat is being eyed by senior leader and former Bhiwani and Hisar MP Kuldeep Bishnoi, state BJP chief Mohan Lal Badoli, former Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia, former state Cabinet Minister Om Prakash Dhankar, and former MP Sunita Duggal.\nBishnoi, a three-time MLA and two-time Lok Sabha MP, met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Wednesday. BJP sources told The Indian Express that Bishnoi wanted to reach the Upper House of Parliament just as fellow Congress rebel Kiran Choudhry did in September. Choudhry quit the Congress in June and joined the BJP. Three months later, she moved to the Rajya Sabha, winning from the seat that Congress’s Deepender Hooda vacated after he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rohtak. Choudhry was elected unopposed after the Congress did not field any candidate because of inadequate numbers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis time too, the BJP nominee is all set to be elected unopposed as the party has an absolute majority with 48 MLAs in the 90-member House and enjoys the support of three Independent MLAs. The Congress has 37 MLAs and the Indian National Lok Dak has two legislators.\n“Kuldeep Bishnoi is trying hard not to let this opportunity go. It is, however, the party’s central leadership that will decide who will be considered for the Rajya Sabha. Everybody will follow the party’s decision,” a senior BJP leader told The Indian Express.\nBishnoi, according to party insiders, was interested in September too, holding several meetings with senior leaders in Delhi. But the central leadership ultimately decided to send Choudhry to Parliament. This time, his position is a bit more weakened as his son and former Adampur MLA Bhavya Bishnoi lost the family seat for the first time in history. The Bishnoi family had distanced itself from the BJP’s programmes after the results, with both father and son not being seen in party events, including one that CM Saini attended on November 25 in Hisar. Before that, they did not attend party meetings convened by Badoli in Hisar. BJP leaders said the Bishnois were unhappy at being given prominence in the state unit.\nAmong the other top contenders are Badoli, who lost the Lok Sabha polls this year from Sonipat; former Karnal MP Bhatia who gave up the seat for Manohar Lal Khattar in the Lok Sabha polls, and was later appointed to the BJP’s election management committee; Dhankhar; and Duggal. The chances of the last two are considered relatively not that high as they lost the recent Assembly elections: Dhankhar from Badli (for the second straight time) and Duggal from the Ratia (Scheduled Caste-reserved) seat.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Bhatia deserves to be rewarded for his performance and taking him to the Rajya Sabha could be it. He also has experience of the Lok Sabha and it will be good for the party if he is considered,” said a BJP leader. Bhatia was the party’s western Uttar Pradesh co-in-charge during the Lok Sabha elections and is a known Khattar loyalist.\n“Whoever is elected shall have almost two years in the Rajya Sabha. Krishan Panwar was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2020 and resigned in October. The BJP’s parliamentary board will decide, with the process beginning after the poll notification is issued on December 3,” said a senior party leader."

        "content": "Does Thursday’s Durban mania elevate Marco Jansen’s pedigree in the international bowling space as a menacing, unplayable beast when at his best?\nAll-time batting lows have been the flavour of late in Test cricket. Sri Lanka’s precipitous collapse for 42 all out at Kingsmead also impressed that Jansen can be as good a rhythm bowler as any, even if he may not have channelled the consistency factor yet. The 6-foot-9 left-armer’s 7-for may have passed on memories of Mohammed Siraj’s Lanka dahan last year.\nJansen, though, is getting steadier even if his latest haul might not be his most skilful work. The seven-wicket sequence comprising three bowled, one caught-and-bowled, and one caught at first, second and third slip each, would rank as a significant numerical hallmark. It also prompted Jansen’s compatriot Rassie van der Dussen, who last played a Test in 2022, to write on social media: “South Africa is the toughest place to bat in Test cricket. Change my mind.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen leaves the field as he holds the ball after taking seven wickets during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)\nFast 7\nJansen’s incredible burst packed Sri Lanka for 42 in only 13.5 overs (83 balls), making it the second shortest completed Test innings in history and the lowest in 100 years since South Africa’s capitulation in England in June 1924 (30 all out in 7.5 overs).\nThe innings also marked the fourth sub-50 total for visiting teams in South Africa, the most for any country in the 21st century. Jansen picked up his first off his eighth delivery. 33 balls later, he was leading his side off the field with the best figures (7/13) by a South African pacer this century.\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen, left, celebrates with teammates after Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka’s out for 3 runs during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, (AP)\nJansen’s spell was the joint-quickest in deliveries to reach seven wickets by a bowler in an innings, matching Hugh Trumble’s 41-ball 7-fer for Australia in the Ashes in 1904. He may not have dismayed the opposition quite like Curtly Ambrose during his famous 7/1 sequence in Perth (he was 0/24 before scalping his first wicket), but Jansen’s 7/9 (excluding extras) will also rank among the best Test bowling sequences for anyone who’s picked as many in an innings. Fourth-best by a pacer, in fact, and the fastest since Ambrose’s WACA massacre in February 1993.\nBest recorded 7-wicket Test sequences by pacers\n7/9 – (25 balls) Monty Noble 7/17 – Aus v Eng, 1901/02\n7/2 – (28 balls): George Lohmann 8/7 – Eng v SA, 1895/96\n7/1 – (30 balls) Sarfraz Nawaz 9/86 – Pak v Aus, 1978/79*\n7/1 – (32 balls): Curtly Ambrose 7/25 -WI v Aus, 1992/93\n7/9 – (33 balls): Marco Jansen 7/13 – SA v SL, 2024*\n• – excluding wide, no-balls\nLevelling up with Steyn, Rabada\nWhile consistency can almost instantly pull Jansen to the top seam-bowling bracket today, his fledgling career is far from middling, jostling between good and great. The 24-year-old went past 50 wickets with the seven-for in his 23rd innings, moving up to 56 scalps with a 20.17 average. That puts him on par with South Africa’s four-best pacers this century. His teammate Kagiso Rabada, north of 300 scalps, reached 50 in his 22nd innings. Jansen drew level with SA’s highest-wicket taker, the legendary Dale Steyn who got his 50th in his 23rd innings. He ranks ahead of Morne Morkel and Makhaya Ntini, who got theirs in 29 and 32 innings respectively.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKagiso Rabada in action\nThe strike rates are holding pretty well – Jansen’s 36.08 is the second-best of all time (min. 2000 balls bowled). He would, however, be modest about it in the company of Rabada, who boasts an astounding 38.47 SR for his 314 wickets. So quite fairly, the coast is clear for Jansen to tap greatness.

(AP)\nVisiting top-order batting (1-4) averages have collapsed to 27.35 in this period, considerably lower from the overalls of 32.93 in 251 Tests. The middle-order (5-8) runs have been vital in this time for travelling units, with as many centuries (4) coming from their bats as the top four – only five runs separating the two sets of batters on average.\nThe spicy decks can also backfire on the hosts, like when India pulled off a seven-wicket win in Cape Town earlier this year in the shortest-completed Test, with an outright result in 106 overs. As Jansen and Rabada will likely breathe more fire before New Year (two Tests each vs SL and Pak lined up), the only glaring deterrent in South Africa’s quest for reaching their maiden WTC final is going to be their own wavering willows.\nADVERTISEMENT\nJansen bowling sequence: 0, 0, 0, Wd, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 0, 1, 0, Nb, 0, W, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, W"

        "content": "Alarming as it may sound, children are spending unprecedented amounts of time online. Young ones are often navigating unfiltered virtual worlds. A recent UNICEF report claims that over 175,000 children log onto the internet for the first time each day—essentially one every 30 seconds. Although this endless stream of connectivity offers education and entertainment, it also puts them at serious risk. \nA recent study by AIIMS Bhopal revealed that as many as 33.1 per cent of teenagers are struggling with depression and 24.9 per cent are battling anxiety in Madhya Pradesh. The study indicates a larger pattern, calling for more attention and supervision from parents. This makes it all the more important for parents to understand the risks and proactively adopt e-safety measures to keep their children safe in this hyper-connected world.\nConsidering the numerous threats faced by children online—be it on social media platforms or through online games—we attempt to tackle this pressing issue head-on. This article is the result of insights gathered from an online safety expert, a child psychologist, and a clinical psychologist.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInternet risks for children and teenagers:\nFrom cyberbullying to online predators, the virtual world is replete with bad actors and harmful content, even exposing them to privacy breaches. While they may not seem hazardous to the unsuspecting minds, their consequences can be perilous. Addressing them is critical, and here is a look at the kinds of risks young children are exposed to as highlighted by experts:\nCyberbullying: It refers to online harassment or abuse with the use of digital technologies. Cyberbullying can occur on social media, messaging apps and games. It is often a repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring or shaming those who are targeted. Kids can be an easy target of online bullies.\nExposure to harmful content: Content that is not age appropriate such as hate speech, violence, and pornography.\nOnline sexual exploitation: Offenders contacting potential victims through social networking sites is one of the traps kids can easily fall into. Grooming is the process during which a child sexual offender draws a child in by gaining his or her trust to sexually abuse the child and maintain secrecy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDisinformation: Encountering false or misleading information or manipulated content online.\nPrivacy breaches: Unauthorised access to personal data of children shared online.\nOnline frauds and scams: Falling for fake apps selling popular children’s products at low prices along with spending money or being tricked through gaming applications.\nFinancial and physical threats: Increased risks due to AI, deepfakes, and other emerging technologies can lead kids to financial and physical threats.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Ami Kumar, online security expert and founder of Social & Media Matters, “grooming, financial scams, and deepfake threats are among the most common and serious online risks for children.” Social & Media Matters is an organization working for child online safety for the past decade.\nICYMI | Are you safe on public Wi-Fi? What you need to know now\nOnline harm is not limited to fraud and scams; another persisting issue is the excessive screen time among children. Unchecked screen time can affect their mental and physical well-being, such as poor quality of sleep, strain on eyes, and reduced physical activity. This can also lead to an impact on cognitive development, social skills, and emotional well-being, making it all the more vital to manage screen time among children.\nScreen time guidelines according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics:\nTo help parents navigate the challenge of online safety, the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) provides screen time guidelines tailored to different age groups:\n\n📌Children below the age of two should not be exposed to any type of screen with the exception of occasional video calls with relatives.\n\n📌Screen time for children between the ages of two and five years should not exceed an hour; the lesser, the better, under parental guidance, monitoring what the children are watching.\n\n📌For older children and adolescents, it is important to balance screen time with other activities required for overall development. These activities include an hour of physical activity (playtime), adequate duration of sleep (recommended sleep time varies with age; for example, adolescents require eight to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep at night), and time for schoolwork, meals, hobbies, and family time. If any of these activities is disrupted due to screen use, then it can be termed excessive screen time, and efforts should be made to reduce it.\nWhat experts say\nDr Jaya Shivalkar, child and adolescent psychologist and developmental paediatrician, said, “The impact of screen time on a child depends on their age. Children aged seven-eight are in a crucial developmental phase, and extended exposure to screens can hinder social and oral development, leading to anxiety, introverted behaviour, and even school phobia.” \nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Shivalkar, another major concern is the increasing disconnect with reality as they delve more into fantasy. “For children over 10, basic learning skills are affected, and compulsive behaviour can develop, resulting in aggression. By adolescence, such behaviours often escalate into addiction. Physically, issues like obesity and deteriorating eyesight are also common concerns.”\nWhile awareness is key, experts suggest that parents need not instill fear in children about the internet. (Image: FreePik)\nMoreover, being exposed to inappropriate content at a young age can be detrimental to their overall development. “Exposure to inappropriate content online can have a variety of consequences. Children and adolescents may experience anxiety and fear. It is common to see graphics or hate-based content that aren’t censored online and that can cause a lot of fear,” said Sharmishtha Hardas, a clinical psychologist. \nHardas feels that the use of social media can also set unrealistic standards of beauty and lead to comparison and lowered self-esteem. “In severe cases, body dissatisfaction can lead to eating disorders and body dysmorphia,” she said.\nHow can parents identify the warning signs?\nAccording to experts, the following are the warning signs that can help parents identify if their children are in trouble:\nADVERTISEMENT\nBehavioural changes: Changes such as becoming unusually quiet or aggressive; requesting more money, privacy, or alone time; avoiding age-appropriate activities like going out, eating with family, or playing; displaying irritability, aggression, or abusive behaviour when gadgets are taken away are some behavioural changes parents spot.\nEmotional indicators: Mood swings or being unusually secretive can be one of the major emotional indicators, social withdrawal or isolation and even decline in academic performance can be usual warning signs for parents.\nPhysical and routine changes: Spending more time on mobile phones, often secretly, sleep disturbances or complaints of headaches can also be considered as primary warning signs.\nGeneral observation: Any noticeable change in a child’s behavior typically has a reason, and in today’s context, it often stems from online activity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRole of communication between parents and kids:\nShivalkar believes that parents should become role models for kids. “Parents should set good examples. If they use their smartphones all the time, then they cannot talk to kids about their ill effects. There is a need for conscious parenting. And, parents must be more alert, educated, and aware than the kids,” she said. “Parents should encourage kids to indulge in alternative hobbies such as arts and sports.”\n“Parents need to develop the art of holding conversations while keeping their child’s comfort in mind. These conversations need not be limited to online safety but can also include topics like sexuality, drug use, and education,” says Kumar. The online safety expert asserts that before giving a child access to a device or Wi-Fi network, parents should understand its purpose and be informed about the apps their child uses.\nAlso Read | Is your child addicted to smartphones? Psychologist shares 7 reasons to be concerned\n“Avoid installing apps unless you know what they do, who uses them, and the type of interactions they allow. Simply following trends is unsafe. A quick search, such as the app’s name followed by ‘child safety,’ can provide useful details about the app and its security features. Once your child is online, engage them in conversations about their activities—for example, ask what games they play or how things are going,” said Kumar, adding that the earlier parents intervene, less harm is likely to occur.\n“For kids under 8 years of age, the conversations should be around what they see on the internet, teaching them not to share personal details online, and avoiding interactions with strangers. For pre-teens, the discussion should focus on the significance of privacy settings on apps, digital footprint, and the importance of avoiding inappropriate content,” said Hardas. \nADVERTISEMENT\nCommunication is key to keeping your child safe online. (Image: FreePik)\nHardas says recognising cyberbullying, reporting it and informing parents should be encouraged among children. She emphasised that there is no need to instill fear in their children about the internet.\nWhat about a child’s privacy?\nIn an ideal world, parents should respect their child’s privacy online. However, this respect should be balanced with appropriate guidance and supervision to ensure they are safe.\nKumar strongly feels that respecting a child’s privacy is a foreign concept created by big tech companies. “A child’s privacy can be secondary to their safety. Till the age of 18, it is parents, school, and society that are responsible for the child’s safety,” he said, highlighting that it is completely on the parent to keep their child safe.\nShivalkar too feels that parents are afraid to infiltrate the privacy of their kids. But up to 18 years, all screen content needs to be monitored by parents. On the other hand, Kumar notes that parental controls are effective. \nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Your smartphone is frying your brain: Neuroscientist explains how increased screen time is impacting our lives\n“Most platforms and apps have the option of parental controls. Parents can also find multiple options to customise the online experience. Instagram has recently launched a new feature where algorithms can be completely reset; this makes sure young ones are only seeing content that is entertaining, educating, and fun for them, and none of the harmful content comes into their timeline if they are using their parents’ phone,” said Kumar. \nWhere to seek help?\nExperts always mention that parents should seek help the moment they feel that something is off, but from where and how are questions. Shivalkar offers a simple answer, “Pediatricians where your kids go since they are born is where you take them once you notice warning signs. Pediatricians all over the country are constantly trained to deal with these issues. And taking children to them is less of a task, since they are accustomed to the visit from their childhood.\nCan parents seek help from schools?\nYes, experts suggest that schools can be approached for further help. “In certain cases, children tend to follow things taught in school more and hence parents should ask for awareness activities from school in cases of online safety, schools can play a better role,” Shivalkar said.\n“Schools play a very important role, education and capacity building should come from schools. Parents need to make sure that children are made aware of online safety through schools,” Ami said. \nGeneral guidelines for parents:\nExperts recommend the following tips to help parents keep their children safe online:\n📌Practise open and unbiased communication with your children.\n📌Follow screen time guidelines recommended by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics.\n📌Be firm in saying “no” to gadgets, even if children use emotional tactics.\n📌Lead by example and limit your gadget use at home.\n📌Watch for early signs of screen addiction.\n📌Seek help from a pediatrician or child psychologist if needed."

        "content": "Few fabrics rival the storied elegance of chiffon. Light, ethereal, and timeless, it has adorned queens and commoners alike, cementing its place as a symbol of grace. Among its most iconic champions was Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur, whose effortless style elevated chiffon saris to royal couture. Inspired by her mother, Maharani Indira Devi of Cooch Behar, Gayatri Devi commissioned exquisite French chiffon saris, making them synonymous with understated luxury.\n“Chiffon saris are the epitome of effortless elegance,” said Rohini Singh of Just Chiffons, a Jaipur-based label inspired by the personal styling preferences of India’s royalty. “My mother began making chiffon saris to preserve the charm of pure silk chiffon, which was otherwise hard to find, and that’s how our label was born,” she said.\nInspired by her mother, Gayatri Devi popularised the fabric, commissioning yards of French chiffon to create saris that became synonymous with understated luxury. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)\nFrom ancient China to French haute couture and India’s regal courts, chiffon’s legacy is a journey through time and culture. Today, chiffon continues to enchant, weaving together centuries of craftsmanship, cultural evolution, and enduring beauty.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe origins of chiffon: From aristocracy to couture\nChiffon originated in ancient China as a luxurious silk fabric reserved for the elite. Its journey to Europe in the 1700s brought it into the hearts of French fashion, where it earned its name from the French word chiffe, meaning rag. But this name belied its opulence—chiffon was anything but common.\n“Chiffon has always been synonymous with affluence,” said Mainak Dey, assistant professor of textile design at Pearl Academy. “It was first embraced by European nobility for its delicate texture and was later transformed into a global fashion statement.”\nBy the 19th century, chiffon became a favourite of high couture, celebrated for its ability to drape effortlessly and its semi-transparent quality that added mystique to every garment.\nKareena Kapoor Khan in a chiffon sari from Atelier Shikaarbagh\nThe art of making chiffon\nAt its heart, chiffon is a weave rather than a material. Made using tightly twisted yarns—S-twist and Z-twist—it creates a subtle crinkle that defines its texture. The original chiffon, Mousseline de Soie, was crafted entirely from silk. The process was intricate, with threads spun and woven to achieve a fabric so delicate it seemed almost weightless.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Handwoven silk chiffon is a rarity today,” said Maayankraj Singh of Atelier Shikaarbagh. “Modern mechanisation has replaced traditional methods, but producing authentic chiffon still takes time—up to seven or eight days for a single bale.”\nSynthetic chiffon, made from polyester or nylon, emerged in the mid-20th century as a cheaper alternative. Though quicker to produce, it lacks the softness and breathability of natural silk chiffon. Designer Jaykirti Singh explains, “Synthetic fibres are extruded and woven in a plain weave to mimic chiffon’s texture, but they don’t carry the same tactile luxury.”\nChiffon’s Indian Legacy\nChiffon’s entry into India is steeped in royal history. Maharani Indira Devi of Cooch Behar, impressed by the fabric during her travels in France, envisioned its light, flowing quality as perfect for saris. Her commissions led to the adaptation of chiffon into traditional Indian attire, setting a trend embraced by her daughter, Maharani Gayatri Devi.\nThe then Maharani Gayatri Devi in her trademark chiffon sari (Express archive)\n“It’s fascinating to think how a single fabric could influence an entire aesthetic,” said Rohini.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDifferentiating real from synthetic chiffon\nIn a market flooded with imitations, recognising authentic chiffon is essential. Silk chiffon is soft, luxurious, and has a delicate sheen, while synthetic versions often feel plastic-like and overly shiny.\nALSO READ | From festive finery to generational hand-me-downs, how the delicate jamdani is making a comeback\n“A simple burn test can tell you the truth,” said Dey. “Silk chiffon smells like burnt hair and leaves brittle ash, while synthetics melt and emit a chemical odour.” “Price is another indicator—genuine silk chiffon is way more expensive,” said Rohini.\nChiffon’s evolution and need for revival\nChiffon has adapted to the times, from its origins in silk to its widespread use in synthetic blends. Its versatility has made it a favorite for saris, gowns, lingerie, and even home décor. However, this evolution raises concerns about sustainability.\nJanhvi Kapoor in a chiffon sari from Atelier Shikaarbagh\n“Polyester chiffon may be economical, but it’s not biodegradable. Revitalising chiffon involves promoting organic silk and recycled fibres while preserving traditional weaving techniques,” said Dey.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMaayankraj stressed the role of consumers: “Investing in authentic chiffon supports artisans and keeps this legacy alive. A pure chiffon sari is not just a purchase—it’s a tribute to centuries of craftsmanship.”\nBy embracing authentic chiffon, we ensure its story continues to flow—light as air, enduring as time itself.\n📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram"

        "content": "The Telangana IAS Officers’ Institute and the Telangana IPS Officers’ Association have condemned remarks made by Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) working president and MLA from Sircilla, K T Rama Rao, against Rajanna Sircilla District Collector Sandeep Kumar Jha.\nOn November 26, Rao had accused the District Collector of behaving like a Congress worker and urging BRS activists to join Congress.\n“The District Collector is working as a Congress party worker. Don’t be afraid of such people. Even Chief Minister Revanth Reddy cannot do anything to BRS. District Collectors and other officers who are working as Congress activists would be taught a good lesson when BRS returns to power,” Rao had said while addressing party workers in his home constituency.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It is disturbing to note that it is becoming a norm to cast aspersions on public servants by persons occupying responsible public offices,” the IAS Officers’ Institute said in a statement.\nThe Telangana IAS Officers’ Association also expressed “deep concern and strong condemnation regarding the recent derogatory statement” by Rao.\n“In an unfortunate public remark, the collector was personally targeted and belittled in a manner that undermines the dignity of the officer holding such an important position in the state’s administration and Civil Services at large. We demand that such statements are retracted and an apology for the unwarranted remarks made,” the statement said.\nThe Association said that Rao’s comments questioned Jha’s integrity and impartiality. “The Association calls for immediate cessation of such unfounded accusations and urges all stakeholders to engage in discourse that respects institutional integrity and the rule of law,” it said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKTR, who was a minister when the BRS was in power, has had several run-ins with the ruling Congress since the latter stormed to power in November 2023.\nEarlier this month, Rao alleged that Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy’s brother-in-law was awarded contracts worth over Rs 1,000 crore under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) despite his company lacking the necessary qualifications."

        "content": "The Odisha government has decided to enact a new law with stringent penal provisions to check cheating and other discrepancies in public examinations conducted by various recruitment agencies of the state.\nOfficials said the proposed law would be aimed at effectively and legally deterring persons, organised groups, or institutions that indulge in various unfair means and adversely impact the public examination systems for monetary or wrongful gains. Currently, there is no specific law in Odisha to prevent cheating in examinations.\nThe government plans to pass the law — known as the Odisha Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 — in the ongoing session of the state assembly.\nOffences under the purview of the law\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to the proposed law, actions such as leaking question papers, providing solutions to questions by unauthorised persons during the examination, and tempering with answer sheets or any documents for shortlisting candidates are offences. Violation of security measures to facilitate unfair means, tempering with computer networks or systems, manipulation in seating arrangements, and creation of fake websites to cheat or for monetary gain are also offences.\nThe law says it is an offence for the service provider to hold examinations in alternative premises without the written approval of the public examination authorities.\nPunishment for offences\nAll offences under the new law will be cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable. Any person resorting to unfair means and offences under this law will be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than three years which may extend to five years and with a fine of up to ten lakh rupees.\nThe service provider shall also be liable to be punished with the imposition of a fine up to Rs 1 crore while there is also a provision to recover the proportionate cost of examination from the service provider. In such a case, it would be barred from being assigned with any responsibility for the conduct of any public examination for four years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf the director, senior management or the persons in charge of the service provider firm found of committed any offence under the law, they will be liable for imprisonment for a term not less than three years which may extend to ten years and with a fine of Rs 1 crore.\nSimilarly, if a person or group of persons including the examination authority or any other institution commits an organised crime, they will be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than five years, which may extend up to ten years and with a fine of not less than Rs 1 crore. If an institution is involved in committing an organised crime, its property shall be subjected to attachment and forfeiture and the proportionate cost of examination shall also be recovered from it.\nAn officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) or assistant commissioner of police (ACP) can only investigate the offences under this proposed law.\nAlso in explained | Why is there controversy around NEET this year?\nWhy the law is needed\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn October, hundreds of job seekers in Odisha staged protests demanding the cancellation of online examinations conducted by various public examination authorities for recruitment to posts such as revenue inspectors, Amin, ICDS supervisors and statistical officers citing massive discrepancies in the way the exams were conducted.\nRecently, there were allegations about examinations being conducted in various cyber cafes and small computer centres in shopping malls without proper security arrangements. Last year, the Odisha Staff Selection Commission had to cancel and reschedule the examination for recruitment to fill a total of 1,225 vacancies of which 1,008 are for the post of junior engineer (civil) and the remaining 217 are for the assistant training officer following question paper leak."

We hope and trust that the trial court will not proceed with the matter till the matter is listed before the high court and any further proceedings will be in terms of the order passed,” the Supreme Court order said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe bench also said that “in case any revision/appeal/miscellaneous petition is preferred before the appropriate forum, the same would be listed within a period of 3 working days after the same is filed”.\nThe court said that “in the meanwhile, peace and harmony must be maintained” and recorded the assurance of Additional Solicitor General (ASG) K M Nataraj to this effect.

(Express Photo)\nThe Supreme Court said it will keep the appeal pending and hear it again on January 6, 2025. The bench also clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe appeal contended that the mosque had been in existence since the 16th century and has been in continuous use by Muslims as a place of worship but the matter was rushed through in “hot haste” after a suit was filed by eight plaintiffs who alleged that it was built after destroying the ‘Shri Hari Har Temple’.\nThe suit was presented on November 19, and on the same day, the trial court, in an ex-parte order, allowed the request for appointing an advocate commissioner for a survey of the mosque, the plea said. It added that the order gave no reasons as to why the application was being considered ex-parte and why it was allowed. The court also gave no reasons nor any terms of reference for the survey, it pointed out.\nAlso Read | How Sambhal row was born, post 1878 suit dismissal, post 1976 tension, when a priest met some familiar names\nThe mosque management said that within two hours of the order, the advocate commissioner, along with the plaintiffs’ advocates and police force, arrived at the mosque to conduct the survey which started at 6 pm and continued until 8.30 pm.\nThe team arrived for a second survey on the morning of November 24 and asked worshippers, who were present in the mosque for dawn prayers, to leave the premises, it said. The plea added: “The hot haste in which the matter proceeded and a subsequent survey was suddenly conducted, gave rise to apprehensions in the mind of the residents of the area, which brought them outside their house.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nViolence broke out after the survey team showed up at the mosque and four people died of gunshot wounds. The police, however, claimed the bullets were not fired by them."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/dmk-govt-labelled-central-scheme-casteist-9697233/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "The Tamil Nadu government has rejected the implementation of the PM Vishwakarma Central scheme, launched in 2023. In a letter, dated November 27, addressed to Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Jitan Ram Manjhi, Chief Minister M K Stalin said Tamil Nadu will have its own scheme that is more “inclusive” and does not “discriminate on the basis of caste”.\nA day later, on Thursday, Tamil Nadu MP and Stalin’s sister K Kanimozhi reiterated to the media in New Delhi that the DMK-led government had rejected the scheme. “The scheme resurrects caste and clan systems in which children should take up the profession of their parents. We cannot accept it,” she said.\nWhat is the Vishwakarma scheme?\nLaunched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2023, the Vishwakarma scheme is aimed at providing “end-to-end support for artisans and craftspeople who work with their hands and tools”. The scheme covers artisans engaged in 18 trades, from carpentry, sculpture and boat making to pottery, toy making and tailoring.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe stated benefits of the scheme include recognition of artisans through ID cards and skill upgradation through training programmes that extends from five to 15 days with a daily stipend of Rs 500. The beneficiaries are also eligible for a Rs 15,000 incentive to buy tools, and loans of up to Rs 3 lakh at a concessional interest rate of 5%. The scheme also provides for a digital transaction incentive of Re 1 per transaction for up to 100 transactions, which will be directly credited to the account of the beneficiary. As per the scheme, marketing support will also be provided to the artisans.\nWhy is it facing criticism?\nThe scheme, however, has drawn criticism for a mandatory clause included in its implementation.\nAs per the scheme, every applicant should declare that his or her profession or trade is “a family profession acquired through guru-shishya tradition”. Meaning, only those who have taken up the profession of their parents or family alone will be beneficiaries of the scheme.\n“As per clause 14 of the application manual, the scheme requires that artisans should have acquired the craft from their parents or relatives through an unpaid apprenticeship or guru-shishya apprenticeship. Such unpaid labour is mandated by the caste system, where certain professions are linked only to certain castes and are perpetuated by family ties,” DMK spokesperson Saravanan Annadurai told The Indian Express.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Decode Politics: Why Sanjay Raut is blaming ex-CJI Chandrachud for MVA’s poll debacle\nHow has the Tamil Nadu government opposed the scheme?\nIn a letter addressed to the PM on January 4 this year, CM Stalin asked for three modifications to the scheme.\nFirstly, the letter argued that “the mandatory need for the applicant’s family to be traditionally engaged in a family-based traditional trade be removed” and suggested that “any person pursuing any of the occupations listed in the guidelines should be eligible for assistance under the scheme”.\nStalin also asked for the minimum age criterion to be changed from 18 to 35 years. “The minimum age criterion can be increased to 35 years so that only those who have made an informed choice to continue their family trade can avail of benefits under this scheme”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe CM also wrote that the state government wanted beneficiaries to be verified by a Village Administrative Officer of the Revenue Department instead of the head of the Gram Panchayat.\nWhile Manjhi replied to this letter in March 2024, no modifications were made to the scheme, according to the state government. “As the modifications were not accepted by the Union government, the government of Tamil Nadu decided not to implement the scheme,” Annadurai said.\nWhat does the state government plan to do instead?\nAs per Stalin’s November 27 letter to Manjhi, Tamil Nadu will implement another scheme to “empower artisans… under the overall principle of social justice”.\nThis scheme, which is yet to be launched by the state government, will be “a more inclusive and comprehensive scheme for artisans, which does not discriminate based on caste”, as per the letter.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Centre, however, is yet to respond to this latest letter.\nHave Tamil Nadu and the Centre clashed in the past?\nThe Vishwakarma scheme is not the only issue of contention between the DMK-led state government and the BJP-led Centre.\nTamil Nadu, with the history of its Dravidian movement, has long been opposed to what it views as the “imposition of Hindi”. In 2022, Stalin wrote to Modi stating the imposition of Hindi was both “impractical and divisive”. This was in response to a parliamentary panel’s recommendation that the medium of instruction in national institutes, including Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Hindi-speaking states should be Hindi. But, Stalin pointed out, such institutions enrol students from across the country.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Tamil Nadu government had also sought an exemption for its students from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), calling the exam discriminatory towards rural students who cannot afford coaching classes.\nThe Tamil Nadu government has also opposed the Centre’s “discrimination” against southern states in devolution of taxes. According to the state government, the Centre has been devolving less in taxes to the southern states, including Tamil Nadu, for “performing better” financially.\nIn the long list of Tamil Nadu’s tiffs with the Centre, there is also the stand-off between the state government and Governor R N Ravi. According to Stalin’s government, Ravi has not cleared several Bills passed by the state Assembly."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/australia-ban-social-media-kids-under-16-psychologist-benefits-9697072/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "Australia is taking a bold step in child safety by introducing a social media ban for children under 16. By restricting access until children are 16, the goal is to foster healthier online habits, encourage more face-to-face interactions, and reduce exposure to harmful content.\nThe move has received mixed reactions. Supporters argue that it prioritises child well-being, while critics question how effectively such a ban can be enforced and its impact on children’s ability to learn digital literacy skills.\nCounselling psychologist Srishti Vatsa unequivocally supports the fact that “social media does more harm than good to children at an impressionable age.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHere’s a breakdown of the effects of social media on different age groups, as explained by Vatsa, and why this ban may be a step in the right direction.\nWhy social media can be harmful for kids\nFor Young Children (Aged 5–8)\nAt this age, the benefits of social media are extremely limited, even with access to educational content.\nAccording to Vatsa, “Children can quickly become addicted to screen time, leading to reduced physical activity and disturbed sleep or eating patterns.” These factors are crucial for healthy growth.\nResearch also suggests that excessive exposure at this age can hinder impulse control, social behaviour, and emotional regulation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor Pre-Teens (Aged 9–12)\nPre-teens are at a critical stage of self-discovery, and while social media may offer creative outlets and a way to connect with friends, it also brings increased risks.\nVatsa warns of the dangers of cyberbullying and online predators, especially as children in this age group begin to develop more independence and may hide their online activities from parents. “Unhealthy screen habits can interfere with emotional and social development, putting them at a disadvantage in forming real-world relationships,” she adds.\nBy restricting access until children are 16, the goal is to foster healthier online habits, encourage more face-to-face interactions, and reduce exposure to harmful content. (Image: iStock)\nFor Teenagers (Aged 13–16)\nTeenagers gain the most from social media in terms of social connections and access to supportive communities, especially during their formative years of understanding their bodies and sexuality. However, these benefits often come at a cost.\nVatsa notes that “teens are more susceptible to anxiety, depression, and body image issues, often exacerbated by online relationships and the pressure to maintain a curated digital persona.” Sleep deprivation, another common consequence of excessive screen use, can further harm their mental health and academic performance.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat parents can do\nVatsa suggests that parents use this ban as an opportunity to instill better offline habits. She recommends:\nEncouraging physical activities and hobbies to reduce screen dependence.\nDiscussing the potential dangers of social media openly.\nSupervising children’s online activities to ensure safe internet use.\nPromoting family time to build stronger connections outside the digital world.\nWhile Australia’s ban may not be a universal solution, it sheds light on the growing need to address the adverse effects of social media on young minds. As Vatsa aptly concludes, “The digital world offers many opportunities, but children need to be guided to ensure it doesn’t do more harm than good.”\n📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram"

        "content": "With regular skipper Rohit Sharma returning to the fold, he is likely to open the innings against Australia in the 2nd Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide. Veteran batter Cheteshwar Pujara, however, feels that due to KL Rahul’s decent form in the 1st Test, the Karnataka batter should continue to open.\n“I think, for some reason if we can carry on with the same batting order, like KL and Yashasvi to open, Rohit could come in at three, and Shubman could come in at five,” Pujara said in a chat with ESPNcricinfo.\n“If Rohit wants to open, KL should bat at No. 3. Nothing later than that. I think he has to bat top of the order, because it suits his game really well. I hope we don’t tinker around with that,” he added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWith Shubman Gill set to return to the playing XI following his recovery from the thumb injury that ruled him out of the 1st Test, Pujara explains why the batter would be better suited for the No. 5 role.\n“Ideally No. 5 (for Gill). Because it allows him to come in at a time, even if we lose two wickets early, he is someone who can negotiate the new ball. But if he walks in after, say, 25 or 30 overs, he can play his shots. He can play his natural game. And in case we lose the first three wickets early, Gill walks in and saves Rishabh Pant for the old ball,” he said.\n“(Pant) doesn’t have to face the new ball. I wouldn’t want him to walk in to bat when the ball is hard and new,” Pujara added."

CLAT is scheduled to be held on December 1 and aspirants need to gear up with focused and strategic preparation.\nA two-hour pen-and-paper exam in five sections consisting of 120 questions – English, General Knowledge and Current Affairs, Legal Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, and Quantitative Techniques – requires sharp time management and a solid study strategy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHere’s how to make the most of your remaining days:\nPrioritise High-Weightage Topics\nCandidates are advised to focus on CLAT sections that carry the most weightage of marks, such as legal reasoning and general knowledge, which together account for 50 per cent of the syllabus. Revising familiar topics ensures that your strong areas become scoring zones, which is vital for gaining an edge over the competition.\nREAD | CLAT 2025: Guide to approach current affairs for legal awareness section?\nMock Tests and Practice Papers\nBeing well aware of the CLAT exam format and using time effectively is essential. Take full-length mock tests to review your performance, mark all mistakes, and try to avoid repeated errors to improve accuracy. However, do not overdo these mock tests as they can be tiring too.\nEfficient Revision Strategies\nEffective revision techniques can streamline your CLAT revision process with the help of brief note preparation. Instead of trying to study new material, concentrate on core concepts and priority areas. To reinforce tricky topics, use mind maps or flowcharts to reduce complexity. Address weak areas, but avoid ignoring CLAT sections where you already shine.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGeneral Knowledge and Current Affairs\nIt is crucial to ensure you’re up-to-date on recent events, so review the past nine months’ current affairs. Use online quizzes or summaries for quick revision. Since this section can be a game changer for a candidate’s overall score, dedicating sufficient time to it is crucial.\nREAD | CLAT 2025: What and how to prepare in the last few months\nTime-Saving Techniques and Formulas\nFor quantitative techniques, practice only the key formulae and shortcuts on which questions frequently get asked. Repetition and practice are your friends, but balance is important to maintain confidence.\nPositive attitude\nStudying for CLAT can be mentally draining, so make sure you’re in the best state of mind and body. Drink plenty of water, eat healthy, and sleep for 7-8 hours daily. Simple exercises or even some relaxation techniques can help relieve stress. At the same time, avoid comparing your preparation with others and trust your hard work.\n— The author is the UG Product Head at Career Launcher"

Lai’s planned stopovers drew criticism from Beijing.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said if the US wants to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the issue “with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.”\nMao said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the US and Taiwan, and visits by the latter’s leaders to the US for any reason.\nWhen his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, began a stopover in the US on her way to Central America last year, China said it was closely watching and would “resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a “stern warning” over what it called collusion between “separatists and foreign forces” days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the US.\nChina objects strongly to such US stopovers by Taiwanese leaders, as well as visits to the island by leading American politicians, terming them violations of the US commitment not to afford diplomatic status to Taiwan after Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.\nWith the number of its diplomatic partners declining under Chinese pressure, Taiwan has redoubled efforts to participate in international forums, even from the sidelines."

This came as a surprise because it was thought that the consignment was not meant for India. We are trying to find out why they fed the coordinates of these two places in Andaman,” DGP Hargobinder Singh Dhaliwal told PTI.\nIt is under investigation whether they had plans to unload a portion of the consignment in Andaman, he said.\nDhaliwal said, “Apart from making calls to people in South East Asian countries, the smugglers also contacted a person in North India. We have alerted the agencies concerned and are looking into details about this person.” As part of the investigation, the police are trying to find out who bought the Starlink internet device the smugglers were using mid-sea, and when and its usage history, he said.\nStarlink, a service provided by SpaceX — the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk — is an international telecommunications provider offering coverage in over 100 countries, but not in India.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt present, the arrested foreign smugglers are in police custody.\nOn November 23, a pilot from the Coast Guard Dornier aircraft, while on routine patrolling, noticed suspicious movement of a fishing trawler near Barren Island, approximately 150 km from Port Blair.\nThe trawler was warned to slow down, and the pilot alerted the Andaman and Nicobar Command. A nearby fast-patrolling vessel then responded and towed the trawler to Port Blair on November 24 for further investigation.\nAuthorities suspect that the drug consignments may be linked to notorious international cartels, such as Tse Chi Lop’s (the Chinese El Chapo) or Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes’ (El Mencho) operations."

From the third decade of life, muscle strength and mass dropped dramatically for sedentary individuals as opposed to active individuals (defined as at least 150 minutes of activity per week) across one’s lifespan. This means half of the strength and size from the peak of the third decade of life to the sixth decade of life is lost for sedentary individuals, affecting their daily activities and making them vulnerable to chronic diseases. Active individuals, on the other hand, retained almost all of their physical function even in their ninth decade of life.

        "content": "India Q2 GDP Growth Rate:  INDIA’S REAL Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in July-September 2024 pulled down by “sluggish growth” in manufacturing and a deceleration in mining and quarrying, data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Friday showed.\nThe 5.4 per cent growth rate in Q2 is lower than 6.7 per cent in the April-June quarter and 8.1 per cent in July-September 2023. It is at least a percentage point lower than the consensus estimate arrived at through a poll of economists.\nSeveral factors added up to what Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran described as a “disappointing but not alarming” lower growth rate in Q2. Going forward, he said, doubling down on deregulation, expanding state capacity for public investment, and improving hiring and compensation policies in the private sector, will improve growth prospects and turn the second quarter numbers into a fading memory.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Bulk of the slowdown has been predominantly due to the manufacturing sector. And some of it is partly due to the presence of excess capacity elsewhere and imports dumping in India and naturally the manufacturing process slowed down,” he said.\nManufacturing, which accounts for over 17 per cent of the total Gross Value Added (GVA) output, grew by just 2.2 per cent in July-September as against 7 per cent growth in April-June and 14.3 per cent growth in the corresponding period last year. Mining and quarrying seem to have been sharply hit by the extended rainfall as it recorded a contraction of 0.1 per cent in July-September compared with 7.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter and 11.1 per cent in the year-ago period.\nThere were some bright spots though, Nageswaran said. “Agriculture has done quite well. The other bright spot is construction. Over the last full year, the construction sector has been growing at very high single digits and continued that growth rate in the first half of the current financial year as well,” he said.\nTo a question on the need for an interest rate cut, the CEA said the numbers were available for all to see, including the RBI. “They know what to do and I will not be commenting on this,” Nageswaran said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen asked if there is risk to the Economic Survey’s growth projection of 6.5-7 per cent for the full financial year he said, “It is too soon to say that even 6.5 per cent is in danger. I don’t think we should extrapolate too much,” Nageswaran said.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has projected a much higher GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent for 2024-25 and 7.1 per cent for FY26. Last week, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth had said there is “no significant downside risk” to the 6.5-7 per cent growth projection for this year.\nAmong the primary sectors, agriculture grew 3.5 per cent in July-September as against 2 per cent in the previous quarter and 1.7 per cent in the year-ago period. Construction sector recorded a “high single digit” growth of 7.7 per cent in Q2. It had grown at a much higher rate of 10.5 per cent in Q1 and 13.6 per cent in the year-ago period. Services sector grew slower than expected at 7.1 per cent in Q2 as against 7.2 per cent in Q1 and 6 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago.\nPrivate final consumption expenditure, an indicator of consumption demand, grew by 6 per cent to Rs 24.82 lakh crore in July-September as against 7.4 per cent growth in Q1 and 2.6 per cent a year ago. Government final consumption expenditure grew 4.4 per cent in Q2 compared with a contraction of 0.2 per cent in Q1, and 14 per cent growth in Q2 previous year.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Despite sluggish growth observed in ‘manufacturing’ (2.2%) and ‘mining & quarrying’ (-0.1%) sectors in Q2 of FY 2024-25, real GVA in H1 (April-September) has recorded a growth rate of 6.2%,” the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation said. GDP is GVA plus net taxes on products (taxes less subsidies).\nGovernment expenditure in Q1 (Rs 4.15 lakh crore) was said to be suppressed due to model code of conduct in view of the Lok Sabha elections, but the NSO data shows that in absolute terms, it was lower in Q2 at Rs 4.01 lakh crore."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-pakistan-disagree-champions-trophy-icc-meeting-9697604/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "The impasse over the future venue of the Champions Trophy is set to continue for a few more days after no decision was arrived at the crucial International Cricket Council’s board meeting on Friday. The Indian Express understands that during the brief meeting held virtually, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has outright rejected the hybrid model, which will allow India to play its matches in a neutral venue. As a result, the hosts PCB have been granted time to arrive at a plausible solution with the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\nAt the end of the meeting that lasted less than 15 minutes, PCB, BCCI and the ICC were told to present a formula that would be acceptable for all parties with regards to the venue of the Champions Trophy. It is learnt that whichever formula is put forward and approved, has to be cleared by both the governments of India and Pakistan.\nAccording to multiple sources, some alternate workable options are expected to be tabled at the next meeting which could take place as early as Saturday evening. It is understood that the hybrid model still remains the most favoured one except for PCB, which is strong in its stance that the entire tournament should take place in Pakistan.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs per the hybrid model all of India’s three group matches including the one against Pakistan will be played in a neutral venue and so would a semi-final and final should Rohit Sharma’s team make it to the knockouts. As things stand, the hybrid model looks highly unlikely, unless the PCB changes its stance. But with both the governments involved, there are fears in the ICC circles that the hybrid model which the PCB accepted during last year’s Asia Cup may not happen this time.\nIf the PCB rejects the hybrid model and a model that is accepted to all parties is not arrived at, then the ICC is likely to explore the option of moving the entire Champions Trophy out of Pakistan. It is understood that the ICC hasn’t sounded out any other member as yet, but it is expected to take stock of alternate options with the UAE and South Africa being the favoured destinations as of now, especially because the timing would suit the broadcasters.\nIf it is UAE, weather won’t be a cause of concern as the temperature is usually known to be pleasant in February-March. South Africa too remains a likely destination as it would come towards their end of their summer."

        "content": "Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Friday terminated two government employees from service for their alleged terror links, officials said.\nThe fired employees have been identified as Abdul Rehman Naika who worked as a pharmacist in the health department, and Zahir Abbas, a teacher in the school education department, they added.\nSinha invoked Article 311 (2) (c) of the Constitution to terminate the two employees after a probe by the law enforcement and intelligence agencies “clearly established their terror links”, officials said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe LG has ordered termination of several government employees over the past few years under the same provision.\nNaika, a resident of Devsar in Kulgam district, was appointed as a medical assistant in 1992.\n“His links with Hizbul Mujahideen was unearthed after the police launched a probe into the killing of Ghulam Hassan Lone, a staunch nationalist in Devsar whose three sons are serving in security forces.\n“Lone was killed by terrorists in August 2021. The probe revealed that Naika was one of the plotters of killing aimed at creating a state of fear and insecurity among the patriotic people,” officials said.\nThe investigation revealed that Naika played a key role in nourishing, strengthening and proliferating a conducive ecosystem for secessionism and terrorism, not only in Kulgam, but also in the neighbouring Shopian and Anantnag districts, they added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAfter Lone’s murder, the police tracked the footprints of the overground workers (OGWs) providing logistical support to the terrorists, they said.\nNaika and his associates were nabbed with hand grenades and AK 47 ammunition. During interrogation, he confessed to have received direction from his handlers in Pakistan to carry out a terrorist attack in Kulgam by lobbing grenades on security forces and political persons, officials said.\n“He also admitted that as an OGW, his job was to conduct reconnaissance of targets. In the killing of Lone, Naika and his associates kept a watch on his movement and on the day of the murder, he mounted surveillance in the area to provide a safe passage to the attackers,” they added.\nDuring investigation, “his role as an Hizbul Mujahideen aide facilitating attacks on police personnel was also unearthed”, officials said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Naika was a rabid OGW and a hardcore terror associate for various outfits, in particular the Hizbul Mujahideen, and used his privilege as a government employee to target people, police and political leaders,” they said.\nThe second employee to face action — Abbas — is a resident of Badhat Saroor area in Kishtwar district.\n“A graduate from Aligarh Muslim University, Abbas was posted as a teacher at the government high school in Bugrana in 2012. He was arrested in September 2020 for harbouring three active Hizbul terrorists in Kishtwar. He is currently lodged at the Kot Bhalwal prison,” officials said.\nDuring investigations into terror activities in Kishtwar, Abbas’ role as a hardcore OGW came to light.\n“After his arrest, Abbas gave inputs of hideouts where arms and ammunition were stored, besides identifying two OGWs — Gulzar Ahmad and Mohammad Hanief,” they said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAbbas was also providing critical information about force movements to his handlers in Pakistan, they added.\n“He also helped terrorists on the ground with food, shelter, and arms besides enabling them to evade arrest and plan attacks. His presence in a school where he had the potential to influence, indoctrinate and radicalise students fundamentally contradicts the principles of education and poses a direct threat to the stability and security of the nation.\n“Even today, discreetly obtained intelligence inputs suggest that Abbas continues to indulge in radical activities while in jail,” the officials said.\nThe two cases are “clear examples of Pakistan’s ISI and Pakistan-based terror outfits infiltrating the system”. They also reveal these outfits’ sinister strategy to sustain terror activities and secure finances from Indian exchequer while subverting the system from within, they said.\nThe officials added that during a recent security review meeting, the LG vowed to wipe out terrorists, their supporters and those aiding and abetting them from within the system."

        "content": "Nestled in the heart of Rajasthan, the Ajmer Sharif Dargah stands as a testament to spiritual harmony, cultural richness, and historical significance. The shrine of Khwaja Moin-ud-din Chishti, fondly known as Gharib Nawaz (Benefactor of the Poor), attracts millions of devotees from across the world, transcending religious boundaries.\nIt traces its origins to the late 12th century. According to historical records from the ‘Siyar-ul-Auliya’ (a comprehensive biography of Sufi saints), Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti arrived in Ajmer from Persia around 1192 CE, establishing the foundations of the Chishti Sufi order in India. His teachings emphasised universal love, peace, and spiritual equality.\nAccording to the Rajasthan government’s tourism website, “In keeping with his secular teachings, its doors are open to people of all faiths and religions. Some say that Khwaja Moin-ud-din Chishti believed he was a direct descendant of Muhammad and preached his beliefs to the masses. While on his world travels, he was urged by Muhammad, in a dream, to visit India. He reached Ajmer, via Lahore, and made it his home from 1192 till his death in 1236 AD. The shrine was built by Mughal King Humayun in honour of this saint.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArchitectural marvel\nThe Dargah complex is a stunning example of Indo-Islamic architecture. The white marble shrine, adorned with intricate silver and gold decorations, reflects the architectural sophistication of the medieval period. The main gate, known as the Nizam Gate, was donated by the Nizam of Hyderabad in the 19th century, symbolising the widespread reverence for the saint.\nAccording to Explore Rajasthan, this iconic monument is a “true representative of the Mughal style of architecture”  with the structure of the Dargah having “the touches of Humayun to Shah Jahan.” The grave is encased within a silver railing and adorned with a marble screen. Nearby, a dedicated prayer room, constructed by Chimni Begum, the daughter of Shah Jahan, offers a serene space exclusively for women.\nSpiritual significance\n“The Ajmer Sharif Dargah is considered to be among the holiest Muslim shrines in India,” as mentioned by the Department of Tourism, Government of Rajasthan. What makes Ajmer Sharif unique is its universal appeal. Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and people from various backgrounds visit the shrine, seeking blessings and spiritual solace. The Dargah represents a profound example of religious tolerance and syncretism.\nWhat’s more, several top Bollywood celebrities, including Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Deepika Padukone, and others, have been seen visiting Ajmer Sharif to offer their prayers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKehwa, a traditional Kashmiri green tea served hot, can be enjoyed during your visit to Ajmer (Source: Freepik)\nAnnual celebrations\nThe Urs festival, commemorating the death anniversary of Khwaja Moin-ud-din Chishti, is the most significant event at the Dargah. Held annually for six days, the festival transforms Ajmer into a vibrant celebration of spirituality. Thousands of devotees from across the globe gather to pay homage, with qawwali performances, special prayers and offering chaddars (blankets) to the tomb.\nCulinary delights: The street food experience\nThe area surrounding the Dargah is a culinary paradise. Narrow lanes are lined with food stalls offering traditional Rajasthani and Mughlai cuisine:\nMutton Nihari: A slow-cooked meat delicacy traditionally eaten for breakfast\nTandoori Dishes: Freshly prepared in traditional clay ovens\nMawa Kachori: A sweet delicacy unique to Rajasthan\nKehwa: Traditional Kashmiri green tea served hot\nThese food stalls are not just about sustenance but represent a cultural experience, where flavors tell stories of centuries-old culinary traditions.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCultural impact\nBeyond its religious importance, Ajmer Sharif has been a significant cultural and historical landmark. It has been a center of learning, spirituality, and cultural exchange for centuries. Scholars, poets, and travellers have been drawn to this place, contributing to its rich tapestry of stories and traditions.\nPractical information for travellers\nLocation: Ajmer, Rajasthan, India\nTimings: Open from early morning to evening\nBest Time to Visit: Throughout the year, with special significance during the Urs festival\nEntry: Free, but donations are welcome\nDress Code: Modest clothing recommended, head covering for both men and women\n📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/australia-social-media-ban-challenges-age-verification-9697671/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "Australia’s Parliament has passed a new bill that would ban children younger than 16 years old from social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, and X – but there is a long way to go before the ban kicks into effect.\nThe law was passed by the Australian Senate on Friday, November 29, with a vote of 34-19 after the country’s House of Representatives approved the first-of-its-kind legislation by 102 votes to 13 a day prior.\nAs per the legislation, social media companies are liable for fines up to 50 million Australian dollars (Rs 275 crore approx.) if they fail to prevent children under the age of 16 from holding accounts on their platforms.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday. The social media ban has been introduced to mitigate the physical and mental health risks faced by children due to excessive use of social media. It has also been rolled out in response to misogynist content and harmful depictions of body image shown to teenagers on these platforms.\nHowever, the path to implementing the social media ban on children under 16 is dicey.\n“Even though it’s been passed, there has been a lot of debate within Australia about whether a social media ban is the best way to go about addressing these risks,” said Aparajita Bharti, the co-founder of tech policy organisation The Quantum Hub (TQH).\nFirst, what does the law say?\nThe newly approved legislation is titled the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024. While it bans under-16 children from holding a social media account, they are allowed to access these platforms in a “logged out state”. For example, they can visit the Facebook page of a business or service as this does not normally require users to log into the platform.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe onus of keeping age-restricted users out of social media is placed on platforms. Hence, there are no penalties for users or their parents.\nThe legislation requires platforms to take “reasonable steps” to ensure that the minimum age requirement is met but does not specify these measures. “Whether an age assurance methodology meets the ‘reasonable steps’ test is to be determined objectively, having regard to the suite of methods available, their relative efficacy, costs associated with their implementation, and data and privacy implications on users, amongst other things,” the legislation reads.\nAlso Read | Is your child safe online? A handy E-safety guide for every parent\nAs far as the scope of the law is concerned, it states that the minimum age obligation is only for “age-restricted social media platforms” which has been defined by drawing on the existing meaning of “social media service” in the country’s Online Safety Act.\nMessaging apps, online gaming services, and platforms that are primarily used for health and education purposes are to be exempted from the ban. However, the law does not make an exception for age-restricted users who have the consent of their parents or carers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo ensure user privacy, the legislation requires platforms to only use the information collected for age assurance and nothing else – unless the user gives clear, informed consent to do so. Platforms are also required to delete the data collected after a user’s age has been assured. Additionally, platforms cannot ask Australians to give their government-issued IDs for age assurance.\nWhy is Australia’s social media ban flawed?\nWith the law now having been passed, attention has shifted towards the challenges in its implementation. Stating that children are adept at finding ways to circumvent restrictions on internet and social media access, Bharti said, “I’ve heard of kids using Google Docs to do things they want to do on social media because they want to go around their parents. In that sense, it might put children at more risk as you wouldn’t know what platform they are using and whom to regulate.”\nAustralia’s social media ban could also have a disproportionate impact on youth from marginalised groups who rely on social media to connect with others and access information. “In cases of rape, abuse or trauma, support for victims may come from social media and it could be detrimental to them if you cut them off from these platforms,” said Pallavi Bedi, a senior policy researcher at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS).\nAlso Read | As Australia becomes first country to ban social media for kids under 16, a psychologist reflects on the move\nBharti further emphasised that policy meant to protect children from online harm should be sensitive to the socio-economic context of the country and the nuances of how people interact with technology such as device sharing.\nADVERTISEMENT\nReferring to the situation in India, she cited a TQH survey of 5,000 children from low-income households in Delhi, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand. According to the survey, over 70 per cent of the children said that they use their parents’ phone to access social media while 80 per cent of them help their parents to navigate online.\nHow feasible are age-verification methods?\nSeveral methods exist to verify a user’s age but nearly all of them come with drawbacks. Self-disclosure is easy to circumvent as users are just required to tick a box stating that they are above the minimum age. ID-based verification, on the other hand, raises privacy risks and could put an end to online anonymity which is said to make the internet what it is.\nMeanwhile, Instagram’s ‘Teen Accounts’ require ‘social vouching’ where three of the user’s followers need to vouch that they are not under the minimum age. However, this method is only effective if users already have accounts on the platform. Estimating age based on user behaviour also suffers from the same flaw.\nGiven these limitations, there has been a shift away from age verification towards age estimation and age assurance. Instead of platforms knowing for sure that a user is of a certain age, they can use tools that estimate a user’s age in order to simply indicate whether they are above or below the threshold. Similarly, age assurance methods are used to indicate whether the user falls within the age-restricted bracket or not.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHighlighting a French company’s new tool that can estimate a person’s age based on their hand movements, Bharti said, “There is a lot of innovation happening in the age-verification tech space, and the reason for innovation is because everyone recognises that ID-based verification is not the best.”\nThe Australian government has also roped in tech companies and software testers to conduct a trial on age-gating technology. The trial will see participation from over 1,200 randomly chosen Australians between January to March next year, according to a report by Reuters.\nWhile the purpose of the trial is to determine how the social media ban will be enforced in the country, the government has been criticised for rushing the new legislation through parliament before the outcomes of the trial are known.\nInstead of rushing legislation through parliament without meaningful consultation or a senate inquiry, the government needs to prioritise privacy reform, and at least wait to see the outcome of the $6.5million age assurance trial.\n— Digital Rights Watch (@DRWaus) November 21, 2024"

        "content": "November 28 was a historic day for the Gandhi family – it was the first time Priyanka, Sonia, and Rahul were together in Parliament. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took her oath as the Member of Parliament from Kerala’s Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. Draped in a traditional kasavu sari from Kerala, her attire stirred memories of her grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who often connected with the masses through her sartorial choices.\nThe kasavu sari is deeply intertwined with Kerala’s cultural identity.

        "content": "North Korean threat actors like Lazarus are notorious for using sophisticated methods to hack government websites and gain access to sensitive information stored on government servers. However, security researchers are now saying that hackers from the Hermit kingdom have stolen billions of dollars in cryptocurrency from hired remote IT workers, venture capitalists and recruiters from big companies.\nAccording to a recent report by TechCrunch, security researchers at the Cyberwarcon, an annual conference that focuses on disruptive threats in cyberspace suggest that Noth Korean hackers have been posing as prospective employees who want to work at multinational corporations. Their main motive is to earn money for the North Korean government all the while stealing corporate secrets to benefit the country’s nuclear weapon program,\nIn the last decade or so, researchers say that North Korean hackers have stolen billions of dollars in cryptocurrency. At Cyberwarcon, a security researcher working at Microsoft named James Elliott says that North Korean IT workers have already infiltrated hundreds if not thousands of organisations around the world using fake identities. These workers rely on their US-based trainers to get access to workstations and earnings to bypass international sanctions put in place by countries around the world.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Solar Eclipse in 2025: Date, timings, places, how to watch; all you need to know\nAccording to Microsoft, a group named Ruby Sleet has already infiltrated some aerospace and defence companies to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapon program and navigation system. In a blog post, the tech giant also said that a group named Sapphire Sleet disguised themselves as recruiters and venture capitalists and targeted unsuspecting victims by setting up virtual meetings.\nNorth Korean hackers who impersonate venture capitalists pressurise their victims to download a malware-laced tool that would help them fix these virtual meetings. Other threat actors who pose as recruiters ask unsuspecting candidates to download malware-laden assessments to infect their systems with the aim of stealing cryptocurrency wallet credentials. In around six months Microsoft says these threat actors have taken in more than $10 million.\nHow do North Korean hackers lure IT companies into hiring them?\nAs it turns out, the typical North Korean IT worker campaign involves creating a bunch of online accounts on popular platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub, allowing them to build some professional credibility. These threat actors are also actively using AI tools that let them change their faces and change voices.\nWhen a company hires a remote IT worker, it then ships their laptop to some address in the United States owned or rented by a middleman whose main responsibility is to gather loads of company-issued laptops. These facilitators are also tasked with installing software that allows them to remote access the system, which ultimately allows North Korean threat actors to log in to the system without having to disclose their real location.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThese North Korea-based threat actors also use a bunch of tricks like verifying their false identities on LinkedIn using the very company email addresses they are hired for to make their profiles legitimate.\nHow do security researchers know all this?\nThe Microsoft engineer James Elliott said that the tech giant once got access to a public repository that belonged to one of the North Korea-based IT workers which was full of spreadsheets and documents that helped them decipher the campaign in detail.\nThese documents also contained a bunch of false identities and resumes the threat actors were using to get hired along with the amount of money they have made so far. Elliott went on to say that these repositories act as complete playbooks for identity theft.\nSecurity researchers said they also spoke with a North Korean IT worker who posed as Japanese and noted that the person would make use of words or phrases that don’t exist in the language. The IT worker in question also claimed that they had a bank account in China, but their IP address revealed that they were from Russia.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the last few years, the US government has already issued sanctions against North Korea-linked organisations. This year, several individuals who were either helping these threat actors or running laptop farms have also been arrested, but, according to researchers, the problem can only be fixed by better vetting potential candidates."

        "content": "The one category in badminton that India have had trouble cracking in recent times is undoubtedly mixed doubles. After Jwala Gutta and V Diju, no one has quite cracked the code. Ashwini Ponnappa’s combination with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy offered brief excitement but the former’s booming partnership with Chirag Shetty meant that didn’t last long. Then came Ishaan Bhatnagar and Tanisha Crasto, who could have very well made a serious push for Paris qualification but a serious knee injury put paid to that.\nBut now, there is hope again. Tanisha, naturally more aligned to mixed doubles, is striking a strong partnership with Dhruv Kapila, who has an ace backcourt game and all-round court control. The duo, who started playing together at the Syed Modi International at the backend of 2023, are now into the semifinal one year later. On Friday, putting together a solid game-plan and executing from the word go, the fifth-seeded Indians defeated Malaysia’s Loo Bing Kun and Ho Lo Ee 21-16, 21-13 in just 33 minutes.\nThings got tight in the first game, from 15-10 to 15-13. But a couple of deft touches from Tanisha and Dhruv mixing up his pace to go with usual booming smashes, meant the Indians took the lead. The second game was more straightforward as they took a 10-4 lead and from there it was just a matter of closing things out.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Friday, putting together a solid game-plan and executing from the word go, the fifth-seeded Indians defeated Malaysia’s Loo Bing Kun and Ho Lo Ee 21-16, 21-13 in just 33 minutes. (Credit: UPBA)\nTanisha and Dhruv put together a couple of solid weeks in domestic events at the end of last year, but with the former’s partnership with Ashwini Ponnappa also clicking together at the same time, with a better chance of qualifying for Paris, the mixed doubles plans were put on hold. Dhruv’s doubles partner Arjun MR had wretched luck with injuries and after an exciting World Championships run in 2022, things didn’t work out for them.\n“My main target is mixed doubles now,” Dhruv said. “It was unfortunate for Arjun and me, we were playing really well when the injuries happened. But even in men’s doubles, I played back court most of the time, so I had a good feel for it. I trained 2-3 months to practice for mixed doubles, when Tanisha and Ashwini were trying to qualify for Paris.”\nBut now that Paris is in the rearview mirror, Dhruv and Tanisha have a clear path. There is no big story behind the pair coming together, circumstances played a part in as much anything else. But once the coaches gave them the idea, they knew this had the potential to work. “We mutually thought we could make a good pair. Dhruv is fabulous from the backcourt, and he is really good at controlling the shuttle. He needed someone who could just finish from the front. Touchwood, it’s going well,” Tanisha said.\nAt Syed Modi in 2024, Sathish Kumar Karunakaran and Aadya Variyath (2nd), Sumeeth Reddy and Sikki Reddy (1st) were seeded higher based on their current rankings, but in terms of long-term, Tanisha and Dhruv have a higher ceiling.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDoubles coach SR Arun Vishnu is confident they can be the best mixed doubles pair in the country.\n“Going forward, even for team events, we can have a strong mixed doubles pair. Mixed doubles has been a problem area and they can sort it,” he said. “Both of them are really talented, Tanisha is brilliant at the net, she is brave and has surprise strokes. Dhruv has really buckled down with an improved focus. Both of them are driven to do well, and that is important.”\nTanisha has no hesitation in saying from here on the primary focus is mixed doubles for her. “The coaches see a lot of potential in Dhruv and I, we are 100 per cent thinking long-term. Most of my matches next year will be mixed doubles, as that is the endgame,” she said.\nThe tricky part, however, is going to be managing both mixed doubles and women’s doubles. Tanisha and Ashwini Ponnappa, who are in the semifinals in Lucknow, have continued their journey since Paris. Tanisha said she would continue playing this format as long as Ashwini is, because she has made a commitment to ‘didi’. And for Ashwini, the yardstick is simple: they will pair up as long as they are competing at a good level, without compromising Tanisha’s mixed doubles potential."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/long-reads/story-500-year-old-sambhal-mosque-histories-mythology-legal-fights-9697297/",
        "content": "That the Jami Masjid in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal district — which is now at the centre of a row over a court-mandated survey — was built in 1526 by an official of Babur seems to be beyond doubt. Much else about the mosque is unclear, lost among strands of mythology, history, and legal documents.\nOn November 29, five days after the survey of the mosque led to violence that killed four people, the Supreme Court asked the petitioners to approach the High Court over the matter and directed the trial court to not take any action until the case is heard.\nThe Supreme Court was hearing a plea by the management committee of the mosque challenging an order of the Civil Judge (Senior Division) allowing the survey of the mosque which the Hindu side claims was built by destroying a Hindu temple.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Hindu parties had claimed in the Sambhal court that a “Shri Hari Har temple made by Lord Vishwakarma Himself” originally stood at the site and that it was demolished to build the mosque. They cited a prevalent belief that Kalki, the 10th avatar of Lord Vishnu, will appear in Sambhal in kaliyug (the current era of the world, according to Hindu mythology).\nThe current case is not the mosque’s first brush with a legal dispute. A title suit by the Hindu side was filed over it in a Moradabad court and an appeal in the Allahabad High Court in 1878, but was dismissed by then Chief Justice Sir Robert Stuart.\nChief Justice Sir Robert Stuart. (Express)\nDocuments from that case, available in Urdu and seen by The Indian Express, say that the Hindu side’s plea was rejected because they could not prove the Muslims had not been using the site uninterrupted for 12 years [the grounds of adverse possession], that no parikrama path for circumambulation of the idol seems to exist inside the mosque, and that the witnesses from the Hindu side appeared to be of poor quality who had never seen the mosque from inside.\nThe story of the mosque\nThe Sambhal mosque is known to be the oldest surviving Mughal mosque in the country, and is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe history of the mosque is tied to the history of Sambhal. According to the district’s website, “During 5th century BC, Sambhal was home to the Panchal rulers and was subsequently a part of king Ashoka’s empire.”\nUnder the Muslim sultanate, Sambhal was a part of Qutb-ud-din Aibak’s empire, the Tughlaq empire and an important centre under the Lodis.\nSambhal came under the Mughals after Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the Battle of Panipat in 1526. The Sambhal mosque was built the same year by Hindu Beg, an official under Babur. Only three mosques built during Babur’s reign survived into modern times — the Jami Masjid in Sambhal, the Kabuli Bagh mosque in Panipat (1527-28 AD), and the Babri Masjid of Ayodhya (1529), which was demolished by kar sevaks in 1992.\nThe mosque having pre-Mughal features has been noted by historians too.(Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)\nIn his research paper Patronage of Zahir al-Din Babur [published in Bulletin of the Asia Institute in 1987], American historian Howard Crane says that while Babur’s memoirs do not mention the Sambhal mosque, they do “state that a certain Hindu Beg Qücin, who had accompanied him from Käbul, had been posted to Sambhal in 1515-16 and again in 1528-29”. It is Hindu Beg who built the Jami Masjid, according to an inscription at the mosque.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAmerican historian Catherine Asher has written about the mosque in great detail in The New Cambridge History of India’s Architecture of Mughal India, published in 1992.\nAsher writes that the Sambhal mosque was constructed in 1526 by Mir Hindu Beg, “an important noble in the court of both Babur and Humayun”.\n“Built a year before Babur’s Kabuli Bagh mosque in Panipat, the Sambhal mosque is the first extant Mughal building in India. The complex is entered through a gate on the east that opens to a large walled courtyard. The prayer chamber, like the one of the Panipat mosque, is rectangular with a large square central bay. Its entrance is set into a high pishtaq, recalling those of Sharqi mosques at Jaunpur. The chamber is flanked on either side by three-bayed double-aisled side wings. A single dome surmounts the central bay, and a small flattish dome surmounts each bay of the side wings. The mosque’s pishtaq and other features resembling fifteenth-century Sharqi structures in nearby Jaunpur suggest a reliance on local artisans and designers.”\nMust Read | Explained: Places of Worship Act, and the legal issues in the Sambhal mosque case\nAsher goes on to state that “even though the Sambhal mosque was renovated at least twice in the seventeenth century, enough of its original state remains to show that the plan and general appearance anticipate Babur’s Panipat mosque commenced the following year”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nShe writes that the mosque at Sambhal was the “largest one constructed in the Delhi region since Timur’s sack of that city in 1398. This mosque is situated high on a hill and dominates the city for a considerable distance”.\nThe current claims\nThe Hindu claims of a temple existing at the site stem from the belief that features of a temple can still be traced in the mosque building, and that rubble from a temple seems to have been used in building it. These “features” include a chain hanging from the mosque’s dome, which they believe once held a bell, the columns of the mosque resembling a temple’s, and a path for ‘parikrama’ existing inside the mosque.\nMany of these have been enumerated in an ASI report from 1874-76 by ACL Carlleyle, First Assistant of the ASI, titled ‘Tours in the Central Doab and Gorakhpur’.\nCarlleyle writes, “The principal building in Sambhal is the Jami Masjid, which the Hindus claim originally to have been the temple of Hari Mandir”. He then states that the inscription mentioning Babur – which, he points out, gets the emperor’s name wrong – is believed by the Hindus to be “a forgery of late date”.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The walls of the central square Hindu temple would appear to have been built with large bricks cased with stone, but the plaster with which the Muhammadans have coated the walls conceals the material of which they are made; and I can only say that, on examining several spots where the plaster was broken, I found that in some places stone was exposed. I believe that the Muhammadans stripped off most of the stone, especially such as bore traces of Hinduism, and made a pavement of the stones, turning the sculptures downwards… Underneath the outer steps of the outer court I dug out some fragments of sculpture in reddish sandstone, one of which was the upper portion of a fluted pillar.”\nSir Alexander Cunningham, who was then the director general of ASI, however, disagreed with Carlleyle, adding a note to the report that reads, “The inscription in the masjid, which the Hindus denounce as being forged, appears to me to be quite genuine.”\nHafizur Rehman Falahi, a resident of Sambhal who was earlier a researcher with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), told The Indian Express, “Hindu Beg seems to have repaired an existing mosque instead of building a new one, as the Jami Masjid has features of Pathan architecture more than Mughal architecture.”\nThe mosque having pre-Mughal features has been noted by historians too.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAustrian historian Ebba Koch, in her book ‘Mughal Architecture: An Outline of its History and Development’, writes, “Although he [Babur] is celebrated as a founder of gardens, it is his mosques in Sambhal (1526), Ayodhya and Panipat (both 1528-29) that remain as chief monuments from his brief reign. They attempt to do justice to a large scale by borrowing inadequate forms of the decaying Sultanate architecture.”\nMir Hindu Beg’s mosque, Sambal. (Express)\nMeenakshi Jain, Delhi-based historian of colonial and medieval India, told The Indian Express that evidence did suggest the existence of a temple at the site of the mosque. “The use of temple material was evident in two rosettes on stone steps leading to the eastern gateway, the chain for hanging the temple bell, and a passage at the back for performance of parikrama by devotees, among other tell-tale pieces of evidence,” said Jain.\nShe also said Babur seems to have chosen the three locations of his mosques with great consideration. “Panipat was the site of his victory, but Ayodhya and Sambhal were of significance to Hindus, which he was well aware of. That the Mughals knew about Sambhal’s significance for Hindus can be made out from Abul Fazl’s Ain-e-Akbari, in which he showed awareness of Sambhal as the place where the last avatar of Vishnu would be born. He doesn’t mention the destruction of the temple by Babur and the construction of a mosque.”\nHowever, other historians have dismissed the claims of a temple. American historian Crane, who says that the mosque is built of stone masonry covered with plaster, writes, “Hindu tradition asserts that the mosque occupies the site of and incorporates parts of a celebrated Vishnu temple called the Hari-Mandir, but the appearance of the Jämi Masjid in no way supports this assertion.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistorian Sohail Hashmi said ascribing religion to architecture can lead to misleading conclusions. “If people live and build side by side, their heritages and styles are bound to influence each other. The whole concept of ‘Islamic architecture’ or any religious architecture is misguided. Domes come from pre-Christian Romans, the arch from Sumerians. Mosques in Kashmir and China or older mosques in Kerala don’t have minars. The presence or absence of a particular type of architectural feature does not decide the religious character of a structure. What is important in the case of Sambhal is there is no history of a simmering dispute at the site.”"

When the margins for these players increased significantly due to cheaper distribution from Google Play Store, the margins for non-DFS and rummy players did not improve proportionately. This policy has a far-reaching impact on disrupting the market and throwing many early stage ventures out of business. Innovation and creation thrives on fair market conditions, which is what we are fighting for as a business,” said Saumya Singh Rathore, Winzo’s co-founder.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrima facie, the CCI said that prolonged pilot programmes and preferential policies distort competition, and a lack of transparency in policy enforcement raised red flags about Google’s conduct.\nThe allegations\nIn 2022, Google updated its policies under which it commenced a pilot programme to test hosting of two types of RMGs on its Play Store – Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) and rummy in India for a period of one year. Winzo said that the decision to limit the pilot’s scope to only DFS and rummy apps and disallow all other RMGs, was “devoid of any reason” and “discriminatory and arbitrary”. It alleged that its competitor Dream11, “had gained additional user traction of about 1.7 crores within two months from the launch of the pilot programme”.\nWinzo also alleged that in 2022, Google restricted its advertisements policy by only allowing DFS and Rummy app advertisers to host advertisements, and given the “unprecedented potential” to increase business by accessing users through Google advertisements, restricting its ads was an abuse of Google’s dominant position.\nWinzo also claimed that after a user sideloaded its app (from its website), and proceeded to make an in-app payment through Google Pay, the application showed warning messages like: ‘This person might be flagged as risky. Check again or cancel this payment’ and ‘This is an unusually high amount. Check again before sending money’.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGoogle’s defence\nGoogle told the CCI that since there was no “objective” definition of games of skill in India, with such determination dependent on the specific format, features, rules of the game, it requires a case-by-case consideration.\nThe company also said that the online gaming rules notified by the IT Ministry, which required setting up of self regulatory bodies to determine what was kosher to be allowed on online gaming intermediaries such as the Play Store, were hanging fire.\nGoogle also complained of the “fragmented nature” of gaming legislations in India, where various state governments can have different laws.\nIncreasing scrutiny\nThe CCI’s investigation comes just days after it fined Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, Rs 213.14 crore for “abusing” its dominant position in relation to the messaging platform’s controversial 2021 update to its privacy policy – showing the growing antitrust scrutiny on tech giants in India.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Commission also issued cease-and-desist directions and directed Meta and WhatsApp to implement certain behavioural remedies within a defined timeline. As per the CCI’s order, WhatsApp will not be allowed to share user data collected on its platform with other Meta Companies for advertising purposes, for a period of five years."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/hyderabad/hyderabad-food-safety-crackdown-raids-fear-push-hygiene-standards-9697541/",
        "content": "“Fear,” says the middle-aged manager of a Udupi restaurant in Hyderabad’s Begumpet, describing what’s driving a dramatic shift in the city’s restaurant landscape. “There is a fear of surprise audits. One hundred per cent,” he exclaims, reflecting on the wave of inspections and raids by Telangana’s Food Safety Department over the last six months that have left eateries grappling with heightened scrutiny.\nFrom Udupi joints to biryani hotspots, restaurant owners and staff are adapting to stricter hygiene standards while voicing concerns about the challenges of compliance.\n“These inspections deter unhygienic sanitary conditions prevailing in most hotels. No one can ensure hundred per cent hygiene or foolproof operations but one should at least try,” says the manager who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that his hotel too was inspected and a cockroach was found in a plate of upma. The incident prompted immediate corrective measures, including nightly use of roach repellents.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA threat to culinary legacy?\nA melting pot of cultures, Hyderabad is celebrated for its culinary diversity. From biryani and haleem to kebabs and Qubani ka Meetha, Hyderabadi food is influenced by Mughalai, Persian, and Andhra food traditions. While restaurants that date back to the Nizam era continue to sway customers with their age-old dishes, over the years, street food vendors and trucks have become a go-to place for both locals and tourists.\nBut the sudden raids at popular eateries have brought the city’s food hygiene standards under a scanner, generating considerable anxiety among hotel and restaurant owners.\n“It is not possible to follow the rules of the textbook. There are operational challenges. No one wants to serve bad food or provide unhygienic surroundings. In the restaurant business, we can do only to the best possible extent,” says a staff member of a popular biryani restaurant located in Banjara Hills.\nOver the years, street food vendors and trucks have become a go-to place for both locals and tourists. (Express photo/Rahul V Pisharody)\nSince March this year, the food safety department has conducted 4366 inspections and collected 3,300 food samples. In cases of severe violations (such as the use of rotten meat and vegetables or harmful food colours), 56 prosecution cases have been filed. A total of Rs 66 lakh has been collected in penalties, according to the data available with the department till November. Four licences have been suspended in the last six months.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs per procedure, food safety officers inspect the premises, collect samples, and issue improvement notices when violations are noticed. There is a provision for adjudication and levying penalties in such cases. If samples are found unsafe for consumption, prosecution cases are filed against the food business operator.\nSome of the critical violations have left the officials alarmed. For instance, some restaurants were found storing raw meat, partially cooked meat, and marinated meat in freezers for up to a month, while some were found to be using synthetic powders and artificial food colours that are unsafe for consumption. Some of the reputed establishments were found to be using labels of manufacturing details with advance dates, while some others were using expired products, especially in the case of fast-moving perishable goods.\nTask force team has conducted inspections in Lakdikapul area on 26.11.2024.\n𝗞𝗵𝗮𝗻-𝗘-𝗞𝗵𝗮𝘀, 𝗟𝗮𝗸𝗱𝗶𝗸𝗮𝗽𝘂𝗹\n* The FBO is operating the food business without valid FSSAI license.\n* Leftover food from the previous day was found in kitchen and hence discarded on the… pic.twitter.com/giPAw5fJQD\n— Commissioner of Food Safety, Telangana (@cfs_telangana) November 27, 2024\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nInspections now extend beyond restaurants to include supermarkets, kirana stores, cloud kitchens, and catering businesses. The department is also tackling food adulteration at the manufacturing level. Officials emphasise that the exercise is not punitive but aims to empower consumers to make informed choices about where to eat.\nThe department has initiated voluntary hygiene ratings for restaurants where a third-party agency could rate a food business operator and has also started registering street food vendors. “About 3500 vendors are registered so far. We will soon take up a special drive. At least 20,000 to 30,000 more vendors are expected to apply for registration. This will give confidence to the public regarding eating on the streets,” says Dr C Sivaleela, Director, Telangana Department of Food Safety and chief of the enforcement team for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area.\nTask force team has conducted inspections in Lakdikapul area on 26.11.2024.\n𝗞𝗵𝗮𝗻-𝗘-𝗞𝗵𝗮𝘀, 𝗟𝗮𝗸𝗱𝗶𝗸𝗮𝗽𝘂𝗹\n* The FBO is operating the food business without valid FSSAI license.\n* Leftover food from the previous day was found in kitchen and hence discarded on the… pic.twitter.com/giPAw5fJQD\n— Commissioner of Food Safety, Telangana (@cfs_telangana) November 27, 2024\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We want Hyderabad to become the food capital of India. The city is a great gastronomic treat to the people and we want to ensure that,” RV Karnan, the commissioner of food safety, tells indianexpress.com.\n‘Need to create awareness on dos and don’ts’\nWhile some in the industry welcome the inspections, others argue they are creating undue panic thanks to social media.\n“The negative news that social media channels spread is creating a fear among people eating out. They are driving away tourists to other destinations. This is affecting our tourism and hospitality sector,” says MA Majeed, proprietor of the popular restaurant chain Pista House.\nAmey Marathe, vice-president of the Telangana Chefs Association, likens inspections to taking a test without establishing the rules or imparting education. “If one business wants to be 100 per cent compliant, they could do that. The problem is a lot of them do not know where they need to be compliant,” she says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nK Balaji Raju, retired assistant food controller, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, believes that more training needs to be imparted by the department in coordination with business operators and their workforce. He says there are provisions under the FSSAI rules to train the workforce in a phased manner regarding procurement, storage, and operations. “Such training needs to be done more for all establishments. There is a need for more staff and food testing laboratories in the state. At present, there is only one state lab. We need more mobile food testing labs in addition to the five existing mobile labs. There are about 80 food safety officers in the state. A state like Telangana should have about 200 FSOs. They need to create a lot of awareness on dos and don’ts,” he says.\nIn October, the state government announced a one-year ban on mayonnaise made with raw eggs. The ban was imposed in response to a rise in food poisoning cases linked to raw egg mayonnaise. “The problem is not with egg mayonnaise but probably with the way it was stored. If tomorrow bad chicken or paneer causes food poisoning cases, are we going to ban them too? That’s why there is a need for providing education and training to all,” adds Marathe.\nDr Sivaleela says the government has already decided on the establishment of three more state food laboratories at Warangal, Nizamabad, and Mahabubnagar. Soon, three more mobile food safety labs will be added to the existing fleet of five mobile labs whereas the department has sought for another ten mobile labs. She says the government has also recruited 24 new FSOs, with which each district in the state would have an FSO.\nAt present, the state laboratory at Nacharam takes up about 600 food samples for analysis on an average month. “Keeping any establishment hygienic is not a one-day activity. It is a continuous process and our intention is not to create panic, penalise violators or suspend licenses. In the last six months, there is a visible change on the ground in terms of personal hygiene and sanitation and more needs to be done,” she says."

In light of recent challenges, what are the potential consequences of amending or repealing this legislation?\nKey Takeaways:\n• A bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar asked the court of civil judge (senior division), which allowed the survey, not to proceed with the matter till the high court passes appropriate orders.\nADVERTISEMENT\n• The bench also said that “in case any revision/appeal/miscellaneous petition is preferred before the appropriate forum, the same would be listed within a period of 3 working days after the same is filed”.\n• The court said that “in the meanwhile, peace and harmony must be maintained” and recorded the assurance of Additional Solicitor General (ASG) K M Nataraj to this effect. The ASG, who appeared for the district administration, said, “We are taking care of it.”\n• The Supreme Court said it will keep the appeal pending and hear it again on January 6, 2025. The bench also clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter.\n• The appeal contended that the mosque had been in existence since the 16th century and has been in continuous use by Muslims as a place of worship but the matter was rushed through in “hot haste” after a suit was filed by eight plaintiffs who alleged that it was built after destroying the ‘Shri Hari Har Temple’.\nDo You Know:\nADVERTISEMENT\n• The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, is a pivotal legislation in India, aimed at preserving the religious character of places of worship as they existed on August 15, 1947. This Act has been the subject of extensive legal scrutiny and public discourse, especially in light of recent judicial proceedings and challenges to its constitutional validity. Key Provisions of the Act:\n—Section 3: Prohibits the conversion of any place of worship, ensuring that the religious character of a place remains as it was on the specified date.\n—Section 4: Declares the religious character of places of worship as of August 15, 1947, and bars the jurisdiction of courts from entertaining any proceedings that might alter this status.\n—Section 5: Exempts the Ram Janmabhoomi–Babri Masjid site from the Act’s provisions, acknowledging the ongoing dispute at the time of enactment.\n• The Supreme Court, while delivering the verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, upheld the constitutional validity of the Act, emphasizing its role in protecting the secular fabric of the nation. The Court noted that the Act “protects and secures the fundamental values of the Constitution” and serves as a “legislative instrument designed to protect the secular features of the Indian polity.”\n• Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the Act, arguing that it infringes upon the rights of certain religious communities to reclaim places of worship allegedly altered in the past. In response, the Supreme Court has directed the Union government to file replies to these petitions, while clarifying that the Act remains operational despite these challenges.\n• The Act is seen as a measure to maintain communal harmony by preventing new disputes over places of worship. The Supreme Court, in its Ayodhya judgment, underscored that the law imposes a “non-derogable obligation” towards enforcing secularism under the Indian Constitution. By upholding the Act, the judiciary reinforces the principle that historical grievances cannot be used to alter the present religious character of places of worship, thereby ensuring legal consistency and predictability.\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\nADVERTISEMENT\n📍How Sambhal row was born, post 1878 suit dismissal, post 1976 tension, when a priest met some familiar names\nPractice UPSC Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n1.

Barring 2019 which saw extremely good rains that led to few fire incidents, annually there are a minimum of 1,000 fire incidents. It starts at the farms where the most inexpensive way of disposing farm waste is to burn them. This is not healthy and often spreads from agricultural land to the adjoining forest land. Hence awareness activities are stepped up at the onset of winter,” he said.\n• Deaths caused by wild/bush fire were four times higher in low-income countries than high-income countries, the study said.\n• Lower socio-economic countries were more likely to have higher deaths from respiratory illness caused by fires than higher socio-economic countries.

The talks are past their midway point and thus far, there has not been any major progress on the crucial issue of whether the world will agree on capping plastic production.\n• India has also made interventions on the draft text treaty pertaining to articles on plastic product design and plastic waste management, seeking to build-in provisions for financial and technical assistance, including technology transfer.\n• India sought a clear scope for the treaty which, it said, should not overlap with other important multilateral environmental agreements, for instance, such as the Basel Convention on transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and their disposal.\n• The Indian delegation also submitted that the new international legally-binding instrument to end plastic pollution must follow the principles of the 1992 Rio Declaration. It laid emphasis on the principles concerning ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ (CBDR) and sustainable production and consumption. CBDR refers to the differing contributions of countries in view of their different roles in environmental degradation.\n• India also submitted suggestions on articles in the draft treaty related to plastic product design and plastic waste management. Draft treaty articles on plastic product design refer to the efficient and eco-friendly designs, which would help the product to be sustainable, focussing on its recyclability and its environmental impact at the time of discarding.\n• On both – plastic waste management and product design – India’s submissions stated that there shall be provisions for financial and technical assistance, including technology transfer, to developing countries. On plastic waste management, it stressed that efforts should be based on plans of countries, national circumstances, their capabilities and relevant national regulations.\nDo You Know:\n• India contributes to a fifth of global plastic pollution, according to a study published in the journal Nature in September. It accounts for 20% of the world’s global plastic pollution with emissions of 9.3 mt, which is significantly more than the countries next in the list — Nigeria (3.5 mt), Indonesia (3.4 mt) and China (2.8 mt), the study said.\n• India has made it clear that it does not support any restrictions on the production of polymers. Any restrictions are beyond the mandate of the UNEA’s resolution adopted at Nairobi in 2022, according to India. The country has also sought the inclusion of financial and technical assistance, and technology transfer in the substantive provisions of any final treaty.\n• On the exclusion of harmful chemicals used for plastic production, India has said that any decision should be based on scientific studies, and the regulation of such chemicals should be regulated domestically.\n• India banned the use of single-use plastics covering 19 categories in 2022. However, the country has said that a decision on the issue of including certain plastic items for phase-out in the final treaty should be “pragmatic” and “regulation should be nationally driven taking into account national circumstances.”\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n📍India generates highest plastic pollution in world: what a new study found\nPrevious year UPSC Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n5.

It incorporates concepts like ‘Dharma’ (justice) and ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is one family), aligning with traditional Indian philosophies.\n• The inclusion of ‘Secular’ and ‘Socialist’ in the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment reflects India’s commitment to these ideals. Secularism in India denotes equal respect for all religions, a principle deeply rooted in the nation’s history.\n• The judiciary plays a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution, ensuring that it remains a living document responsive to contemporary realities. Landmark judgments have upheld the ‘basic structure’ doctrine, preventing any amendments that could alter the Constitution’s fundamental principles.\n• The Constitution strikes a balance between preserving India’s civilisational values and embracing modern democratic ideals. It provides a framework for governance that is inclusive, equitable, and just, catering to a diverse and evolving society.\nDo You Know:\n• In 1966, M S Golwalkar wrote that the Constitution “had absolutely nothing that can be called ours”. However, speaking on Hindutva and National Integration on February 7, 2022, the current RSS chief said, “Hindutva is nothing but a true reflection of the Indian Constitution.” It seems that it’s either a deliberate policy to speak in multiple and contradictory voices or there is genuine confusion about the true worth of our Constitution.\n• While moving the Objective Resolution on December 13, 1946, Nehru recalled the great “civilisational journey of 5,000 years”. He termed it the moment of transition from old to new, when this “ancient land” would attain its rightful and honoured place.\n• Purushottam Das Tandon mentioned ancient assemblies at which pandits discussed important affairs.

How does Australia’s recent legislation align with global trends in online child protection?\n• Assess the potential social and psychological impacts on children resulting from restricted access to social media platforms, as mandated by Australia’s new law.\nKey Takeaways:\n• The legislation will make platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X, and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (£26 million) if they fail to prevent children under 16 from creating accounts.\n• The Senate passed the Bill with 34 votes in favour and 19 against. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation by 102 votes to 13.\n• The amendments strengthen privacy protections. Platforms will not be allowed to require users to provide government-issued identification, such as passports or driver’s licences, nor can they demand digital identification via government systems.\n• The House is scheduled to pass the amendments on Friday. Critics of the law fear that banning children under 16 from social media may negatively impact the privacy of users who must prove they are older than 16.\n• While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.\n• Critics argue the government is using the policy to convince parents that it is protecting their children ahead of the general election due by May. The government hopes voters will reward it for responding to concerns about children’s addiction to social media. However, some believe the legislation may cause more harm than good.\nDo You Know:\n• One of the biggest challenges in implementing such bans is age verification. While platforms like Instagram have age limits at present, they simply ask users about their date of birth and do not require verification. As a result, many children enter false information to access platforms. Country-specific age requirements can also be bypassed through Virtual Private Networks (VPN), which can show the Internet being accessed from a different domicile.\n• The South Australian report took note of age assurance methods already being used/tested by platforms in Australia. These include requiring details of government-issued IDs or credit cards and using facial recognition technology to identify potential underage users. However, with data related to minors being shared with companies, serious privacy concerns have been raised over these measures.\n• Studies say problematic social media use — inability to control usage, experiencing withdrawal and neglecting other activities to use social media — has been on the rise. It has been associated with lower mental well-being, higher levels of substance abuse and less sleep.\n• Dr Yatan Balhara, a professor of psychiatry at AIIMS New Delhi, said, “Social media is not the problem, it allows people to connect with others… The challenge is that adolescents, whose brains are not yet fully developed, may not be interacting with it in the healthiest of ways.” He added: “Many adolescents evaluate their worth based on what people say about them online or how many likes they get.” There is a fear of missing out, with constant social media use also making in-person communication difficult. “In that sense, there is a logic to restricting access and use of social media,” he said.\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n📍Why Australia is planning to ban social media for teenagers\nPractice UPSC Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n8.

However, if the global growth shrinks, it would also impact India’s goods and services exports, especially to the US, its largest trade partner.\n• A report by S&P Global, released on Tuesday, indicated that China’s growth could slow to 4 per cent by 2025 due to US tariffs weakening exports and investment. Conversely, India is expected to maintain a robust expansion rate of nearly 7 per cent, taking the “global growth baton.”\n• Notably, the US remains India’s largest trade partner, with bilateral trade surpassing $120 billion in FY24, slightly outpacing India’s trade with China. Unlike China, India’s trade balance with the US is favourable, making the relationship a vital source of foreign exchange.\n• Over the past decade, India’s reliance on the US market has grown, with the US now accounting for 18 per cent of India’s exports, up from 10 per cent in 2010-11. India’s export portfolio to the US is diverse, spanning textiles, electronics, and engineering goods.\nDo You Know:\n• The United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That shift has been a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered trade and an increasingly aggressive China.\n• They are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country.\n• The tariff rates range from passenger cars (2.5%) to golf shoes (6%). Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump’s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n• By raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices.\nBefore the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue driver for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90% of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy.\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n📍Trump plans tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China: What does it mean?\nPractice UPSC Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n9.

How do these terms reflect the vision and values of the Indian state?\n• Analyse the Supreme Court’s rationale in upholding the inclusion of ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Preamble. What implications does this have for the interpretation of the Constitution and the understanding of India’s democratic framework?\n• Examine the debates surrounding the 42nd Amendment of the Indian Constitution, particularly focusing on the addition of ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ to the Preamble. How have these additions influenced India’s socio-political landscape?\nKey Takeaways:\n• A bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said the Parliament’s power under Article 368 to amend the Constitution also extends to the Preamble and rejected the argument that the words could not have been added retrospectively in 1976 to the original Preamble which has a cut-off date of November 26, 1949.\n• The SC judgement said that “while it is true that the Constituent Assembly had not agreed to include the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Preamble, the Constitution is a living document, as noticed above with power given to the Parliament to amend it in terms of and in accord with Article 368”.\n• It said, “In 1949, the term ‘secular’ was considered imprecise, as some scholars and jurists had interpreted it as being opposed to religion. Over time, India has developed its own interpretation of secularism, wherein the State neither supports any religion nor penalizes the profession and practice of any faith. This principle is enshrined in Articles 14, 15, and 16 of the Constitution…”\n• On the challenge to the word ‘socialism’, the SC said “in the context should not be interpreted as restricting the economic policies of an elected government of the people’s choice at a given time… Rather, ‘socialist’ denotes the State’s commitment to be a welfare State…”\nDo You Know:\n• Over her years in government, Indira had attempted to cement her approval among the masses on the basis of a socialist and pro-poor image with slogans such as “garibi hatao” (Eradicate poverty).\n• Her Emergency government inserted the word in the Preamble to underline that socialism was a goal and philosophy of the Indian state.\n• It needs to be stressed, however, that the socialism envisaged by the Indian state was not the socialism of the USSR or China of the time — it did not envisage the nationalisation of all of India’s means of production. Indira herself clarified that “we have our own brand of socialism”, under which “we will nationalise [only] the sectors where we feel the necessity”. She underlined that “just nationalisation is not our type of socialism”.\n• The people of India profess numerous faiths, and their unity and fraternity, notwithstanding the difference in religious beliefs, was sought to be achieved by enshrining the ideal of “secularism” in the Preamble.\n• In essence, this means that the state protects all religions equally, maintains neutrality and impartiality towards all religions, and does not uphold any one religion as a “state religion”.\n• A secular Indian state was founded on the idea that it is concerned with the relationship between human being and human being, and not between human being and God, which is a matter of individual choice and individual conscience. Secularism in the Indian Constitution, therefore, is not a question of religious sentiment, but a question of law.\n• The secular nature of the Indian state is secured by Articles 25-28 of the Constitution.\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n📍The history and debates about ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the preamble of the Constitution\nPrevious year UPSC Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n10.

        "content": "Behind the November 27 tragedy near the Harappan site of Lothal — where a researcher from IIT Delhi was killed when a trench she was working in collapsed on her – are a series of missteps.\nTo begin with, the joint team of IIT Delhi and IIT Gandhinagar, which was carrying out a soil sample survey, hadn’t kept the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in the loop. Two, the dig was carried out within the 100-metre prohibited limit of an ASI-protected site. And three, the researchers allegedly got an excavator working on a road project nearby to dig a 12-foot-deep trench without anticipating the high water levels in the soil.\nThe four researchers – two from IIT-Delhi and two from IIT-Gandhinagar – were at the site on the morning of November 27 to collect soil samples as part of their ongoing research into the impact of climate change on the Indus Valley civilisation when the trench collapsed, burying Surabhi Verma, a 23-year-old PhD student from IIT-Delhi, and her Associate Professor Yama Dixit, who was leading the study. While Verma could not be rescued on time, Professor Dixit was pulled out by the first responders.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDock of the ancient site of Lothal under water; (inset) Surabhi Verma, a PhD student from IIT Delhi, died at the site. (Express Photo)\nWhile Verma and Prof Dixit are from the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) at IIT Delhi, the team from the Archeological Sciences Centre at IIT Gandhinagar, which was providing the logistical support for the study, had Associate Professor V N Prabhakar and Shikha Rai, a Senior Research Fellow.\nA day after the tragedy, Dr Abhijit Ambekar, Superintending Archeologist of the ASI’s Vadodara Circle, who was at the spot to probe the accident, said, “We have no record of any permission being sought for the work that was carried out here. If it had been sought, they would have received the permission with some sort of conditions and even then, someone from the ASI would have been on the spot with them.”\nThe trench was being dug 50 metres from the main gate of the Lothal site which falls within the prohibited area.\nThe excavator used in the dig site. (Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana)\nHowever, speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior ASI official said that while permission is required for any excavation work within 100 metres of a protected site, since the IIT study wasn’t an “archaeological excavation” but a dig for soil collection, it didn’t need the ASI’s nod. “Archaeological excavation within 100 metres of the site needs permission but since this was only digging, it does not require permission. But it is certain that they did not follow the safety norms,” the official said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Indian Express has learnt that the researchers, who arrived at the spot on November 27 morning, approached the driver of an excavator working on a road leading to the proposed Maritime Museum in Lothal and asked him to dig a trench for their study. At the spot on Thursday, the excavator operator told the ASI’s Ambekar that he was told to dig a “10- to 12-foot-deep pit the width of the scoop bucket”, resulting in a narrow trench about two feet wide. Sources said that while Verma was inside the pit, Prof Dixit was a level above her. Above them, on the ground, was the team from IIT Gandhinagar – Associate Professor V N Prabhakar and Senior Research Fellow Shikha Rai – doing the log entries.\nRelatives of IIT Delhi researcher Surabhi Verma with ASI officials at the accident spot in Lothal. (Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana)\nSources say the collapse took the team by surprise – Verma and Dixit were inside, collecting soil samples in the narrow trench, when the soil collapsed behind them, pushing them face first into the wall in front. Locals at the spot described another collapse that followed immediately after, which was followed by a surge of water that filled the pit in no time, burying the two researchers.\nThe Indian Express reached out to IIT Delhi Director Rangan Banerjee but he declined to comment on the matter. IIT Gandhinagar Associate Professor V N Prabhakar, IIT Delhi’s Yama Dixit and IIT Delhi Dean of Faculty and Centre for Atmospheric Sciences Professor Krishna Mirle Achutarao did not respond to calls and messages.\nPolice confirmed that no designated archaeologists were present at the site when the incident occurred, adding that the locals informed the police about the accident. (Express Photo)\nA day after the cave-in, the trench had widened considerably as the soil kept collapsing from the sides – about half the trench was filled with water. Water levels have risen in the region following heavy rains this monsoon season, with the dockyard at the Lothal ruins, 20 km from the site of the tragedy, still submerged.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSub Inspector P N Gohil of the Koth police station, who is investigating the case, said, “The investigation is currently underway. The post-mortem procedure was conducted at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital and the family has taken the body back to Uttar Pradesh.”\nVerma’s cousin Ajir Verma, who had come to Lothal from Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, blamed the researchers for the tragedy. “I’m not an expert but even I can see that you cannot enter a pit this narrow. There is no rope, no helmet, no safety equipment. This is the height of negligence. The team went inside without any safety equipment and didn’t seek ASI permission. The professor was unaware about the soil conditions, the water table being so high and they both went inside without any experts with them,” he said.\n(Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana)\nIIT Gandhinagar released a statement saying the study was being conducted by IIT Delhi and that they had only provided “local support”. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred at Lothal… Although IIT Gandhinagar was not involved in the project, our colleagues at IIT Delhi approached us to provide local support as we are familiar with the archaeological site.”\nIn an email to students after the accident, IIT-Delhi Dean of Students Bijayaketan Panigrahi wrote, “With a very heavy heart, it is our unfortunate duty to inform you of the tragic and untimely demise of our student, Surabhi Verma… Our faculty colleague, Prof. Yama Dixit, and the Ph.D. student, Surabhi Verma, from the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS), IIT-Delhi, had gone to Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for a field trip to collect paleoclimate data. While conducting an excavation, they met with an accident, due to which, sadly, our student Surabhi was fatally injured and passed away. Prof. Dixit, who was also injured during the mishap, is undergoing medical treatment in the hospital.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nDock of the ancient site of Lothal. (Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana)\nProf Dixit has since been discharged from hospital. An Associate Professor at IIT Delhi, she is an expert in paleoclimatology, with her research focusing on proxy reconstructions and paleoclimate dynamics, changes in hydrology, abrupt climate change and impacts on ancient societies.\nSurabhi Verma, the second of four siblings, was from Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, where her father Ram Khilawat Verma is a government school teacher. She was the first in her family to have made it to an IIT.\nDock of the ancient site of Lothal under water, a phenomenon not seen in the last 15 years.

        "content": "The recent accident at Lothal, a renowned Harappan archaeological site in Gujarat, has underscored the importance of adhering to guidelines while taking up field research. Surabhi Verma, a 23-year-old researcher from IIT Delhi, died when the trench she entered to collect soil samples collapsed on November 27. The effort was part of ongoing research on the impact of climate change on the Indus Valley Civilisation. Verma’s supervisor Dr Yama Dixit, a prominent paleoclimate expert, sustained injuries and is under treatment.\nThe incident has drawn attention to the archaeological site at Lothal which has a rich history and draws a significant number of researchers who explore its role as a centre of ancient trade and urban planning.\nLothal – a key Harappan settlement\nThe Harappan Civilisation, South Asia’s first urban culture, included Lothal, a key settlement between the Sabarmati and Bhogavo rivers in Gujarat’s Saurashtra region. The site is believed to be a low natural mound that has been elevated and reinforced with mud and mud bricks multiple times to protect it from annual floods. Interestingly, The name Lothal is thought to have its origins in the Gujarati words ‘Loth’ and ‘thal,’ meaning ‘the mound of the dead.’\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso read | The mystery of the Indus script: Dravidian, Sanskrit or not a language at all?\nSir Mortimer Wheeler in his book The Indus Civilisation notes, “The Harappan settlement bears all the essential marks of the Indus Civilisation: straight streets, with regimented buildings, baths, elaborate drains and man-holes.” In 2014, Lothal was proposed for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage list.\nEarly excavations at Lothal\nEarly excavations in Harappa and Mohenjodaro by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) were met with little excitement, and it wasn’t until 1924 that ASI Director General John Marshall formally announced the discovery of the Harappan Civilisation.\nOver time, new sites have been uncovered, and old ones revisited. As historian Upinder Singh observes in A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India, “The amount of data and information has been steadily growing and continues to grow.” Singh observes that in recent years, scholars have increasingly turned their attention to smaller sites such as Allahdino near Karachi and Ballu in Haryana.\nAlso read | How the British first encountered Indus sites and why it became a national project after 1947\nFollowing India’s independence, archaeologist S R Rao led efforts to uncover Harappan cities in the Saurashtra region, resulting in the discovery of Lothal. Excavations by the ASI between February 13, 1955, and May 19, 1960, revealed an ancient city strategically situated along a major river system on the trade route connecting Sindh and Saurashtra. This site yielded one of the most extensive collections of antiquities in modern Indian archaeology.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWorld’s oldest dockyard\nLothal stands out for its engineering marvels, including the world’s oldest dockyard, measuring 214×36 metres, with an innovative water-locking mechanism. Artefacts such as bead necklaces crafted from amethyst, axes and fish-hooks of copper or bronze point to maritime trade with ancient civilisations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Persia. The city’s design showcased advanced urban planning, featuring a grid layout, sophisticated drainage systems, and a rectangular basin believed to function as the dockyard.\nResearch from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, indicates that around 4,500 years ago, a significant climate shift reduced summer monsoon rainfall in the Indus Valley, devastating regions reliant on seasonal rains. This led to the decline and abandonment of urban centres in southern regions, including parts of present-day Gujarat, such as Lothal.\nRecently, the Union Cabinet approved the development of the National Maritime Heritage Complex in Lothal, a project designed to celebrate India’s 4,500-year-old maritime heritage. The complex will feature a lighthouse museum, a five-dimensional theatre, and interactive exhibits. Upon completion in two phases, it is expected to be the world’s largest maritime heritage complex."

        "title": "Ariana Grande, Chappell Roan and the dark side of fandom",
        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ariana-grande-chappell-roan-dark-side-fandom-9697482/",
        "content": "Written by Kaveri Pillai\nThe international release of the Cynthia Erivo-Ariana Grande starrer Wicked brings back memories of the yellow brick road, but it also reminds one of the backlash pop star Grande faced recently. Grande was subject to online criticism after she separated from her husband and started dating Wicked co-star Ethan Slater. Social media was flooded with posts about possible infidelity and disapproving fans threatening to boycott Grande’s music. With Grande attempting to wade through the sea of rumours, one can’t help but notice the lopsided relationship between celebrities and their fans. Once fans curate an image based on their expectations and celebrities are held to an unattainable standard, the consequent disillusionment that occurs when a star falls short of it becomes apparent. The celebrity becomes purely incidental, their precarious star status beginning to crumble in the very audience’s hands that had built him or her up.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe term that best encapsulates these complex interactions is parasocial relationships. They are one-sided, where one person expends emotional energy, interest and time, and the other person, usually a celebrity, is completely unaware of the other’s existence. This type of interaction also creates fandoms. As fans begin to cherry-pick desirable traits and create an ideal image, celebrities are instantly put on a pedestal. What happens when the celebrity steps out of line? Going beyond the binary, be it good and bad, young and old, creates immense discomfort. So when we see someone try to do both or neither, especially someone who is a product of our love, we spiral. We grieve the loss of an image. And it is the consequent backlash that predominantly affects female celebrities.\nFandom culture isn’t going anywhere but the deification of female stars has dire consequences, reifying gender biases. As fans experience the stages of grief, their backlash re-emphasises the gender stereotypes that celebrities have worked hard to break. This perceived loss can be analysed through how we deal with grief — denial, anger, bargaining, and acceptance — or perhaps, ending with rejection.\nWhen Sabrina Carpenter, a singer who has released chart-toppers like ‘Espresso’ and ‘Please Please Please’ this summer, started embracing not-so-PG-13 themes in her songs, there was a collective gasp. A Disney TV alum, fans wondered, how could a five-foot-nothing blonde who could make the audience laugh at her cute mannerisms possibly make sexual innuendos in her songs. “Bring back baby Carpenter” is a common, albeit infantilising response, as well as a creatively discouraging one.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen pop artist Chappell Roan, known for her public support for queer and transgender rights, declined to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as US presidential candidate and simply mentioned that she planned to vote for her, there was an uproar. Roan fans took to the internet to blame the queer icon for not directly denouncing Trump’s homophobic rhetoric. Thinking that Roan is letting down a community because she has a nuanced opinion is damaging only because they refuse to align with the dominant rhetoric.\nLikewise, when global sensation Taylor Swift was reportedly dating singer Matt Healy, fans initially expressed their disappointment in their idol being with a problematic man with a history of making racist comments about women of colour. This is complicated territory in many ways. Will fans only listen to Swift’s music before her Healy entanglement? Additionally with female stars, it has to be the woman’s fault too when her man is an issue… right?\nThe loss of an image finally hits the depressed fandom. They mourn the loss of an idol. Goodbye, days of obsession, of rosy-cheeked views into celebrities’ lives. Hello, darkness. An icon is dead.\nThe final stage can make or break a star. Does the audience finally denounce the star, making her unworthy of attention? Is she labelled ungrateful, for misusing the platform that fans created for her? Do we take these self-made women and snatch away their autonomy, undo years of hard work and feminist theory, and say “no more”? The fans become parasites, as they chip away at the stars, as they take and take, until there’s nothing left. But, no, they did love them, right?\nThe writer is interning with The Indian Express"

        "content": "All of a sudden, on a drizzly day at Canberra, where he had run innumerable laps around the arena at Manuka Oval, Rishabh Pant, who was lying sprawled on the ground looking at the skies, got up, ran a few yards, and did a gymnastic leap and twirl, and landed perfectly on his feet. For some reason, the big screen at the ground had the actor Ian McKellen in his role as Gandalf in Lord of Rings in a jittery, loopy almost gif-like video at that point. Not many might have expected it, but the Indian team have proven to be the real lords of the ring on this tour so far.\n“There is a genuine appreciation among Australian fans of the skill and the persona that Indians have shown in the first Test,” says Greg Rowell, a former first-class cricketer, a professional lawyer with his own firm, and a member of Cricket Australia. “They seem to be a happy unit.”\n#AUSvIND #CricketTwitter\nShubman Gill hits the nets ahead of the pink-ball tour game\nWATCH\n📽️By Sriram Veera https://t.co/new7asiDxn pic.twitter.com/4K6NCOIeCX\n— Express Sports (@IExpressSports) November 29, 2024\nThat they are, especially after turning around from being all out for 150 on the first day of the Perth Test. They arrived at Canberra, which has to be the quietest capital in the world, especially of a country as big as Australia, in high spirits. Rohit Sharma, their captain was back with them in the nets session, so was Shubman Gill, batting and looking comfortable after that finger injury that put him out of the first Test.\nRohit had already batted in the nets during the Perth Test when India was on the ascendancy with Kohli charging to his hundred on that third day, but Gill’s recovery would please them ahead of the second Test. “He looked comfortable. The physicians will continue to evaluate him,” said Abhishek Nayar, India’s assistant coach.\n#AUSvIND #CricketTwitter #RohitSharma at the nets in Manuka Oval, Canberra.\n📽️by Sriram Veera pic.twitter.com/WDPd60da3t\n— Express Sports (@IExpressSports) November 29, 2024\nGill first faced throwdowns where the pace was incredibly increasingly raised by the team’s other assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate. After 30 minutes of looking comfortable against throwdowns, he moved to the bowling nets to face Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, and Yash Dayal for a short while.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe forecast for the pink ball practice game isn’t good – it’s expected to rain through the weekend. Even on Friday, there was a light but steady drizzle, but the Indians trained through it. “It shows how everyone is very keen to train,” Nayar would deadpan.\n#AUSvIND #CricketTwitter #YashasviJaiswal and #ViratKohli take turns in a single net, while #RohitSharma continues in his\n📽️By Sriram Veera pic.twitter.com/XN2n83h453\n— Express Sports (@IExpressSports) November 29, 2024\nAt Manuka Oval, their captain Rohit Sharma, who had addressed the Australian parliament on Thursday, was the first to hit the nets and was soon joined by Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli. The ball was skidding around on the slightly-wet patches as rain drops kept falling, but both Kohli and Rohit didn’t seem to mind. Akash Deep was in particular, quite nippy and kept jagging the ball around in helpful conditions. Soon, Jaiswal joined the two senior batsmen, and batted for a long time. Later, Jaiswal would also face throwdowns at the main arena, and even bowl seam-up, and remark in jest, “fast bowling bahut difficult job hai rey!” to no one in particular.\nWhen Kohli, Rohit, Jaiswal were at the main nets, with Gill taking throw downs at the opposite side, some of the team were in the main ground, warming up, running, and playing touch football, standing in a circle and just kicking it gently in the air without trying to not let it fall on the ground. And whenever someone missed, he was greeted with howls of laughter and for a little while it was Sarfaraz Khan who was the guilty party. He would vehemently protest everytime saying the ball was at an unretrievable angle or too far from him.\nShubman Gill hits the nets for the first time since his thumb injury that forced him to miss the Perth Test.\nHere’s how the star batter is shaping up! #TeamIndia | #AUSvIND | @ShubmanGill pic.twitter.com/sZtbvQhgLn\n— BCCI (@BCCI) November 29, 2024\nR Ashwin bowled at the main nets.

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/long-reads/maharashtra-suman-kale-custodial-death-family-fight-for-justice-woman-police-9696404/",
        "content": "When his mother Suman Gajanan Kale, a 50-year-old social activist from the Pardhi tribe, didn’t return home hours after she was allegedly picked by the police in Burudgaon village in Maharashtra’s Ahilyanagar (then Ahmednagar) district in May 2007, Saheba, then 22, set off towards the local police superintendent’s office to ask what happened. What he eventually discovered was shocking – Suman had died in police custody, allegedly after being tortured.\nSeventeen years later, the wheels of justice continue to turn slowly. Charges in the case have yet to be framed and trial has yet to begin. After years of pushing, Suman’s family finally saw some progress last month, when the Maharashtra government appointed advocate Prakash Salsingikar as special public prosecutor (SPP).\nBut when the SPP went to the Ahmednagar court for a hearing on November 19, he found that there wasn’t a single policeman from the state’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) – the unit probing the case — there to assist him.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn their part, both district police and the CID claim that the activist died by suicide after consuming poison – although the latter maintains that it was custodial ‘torture’ that prompted her to take that action. But Suman’s family refutes the claim, saying they were now fighting in two fronts – a legal battle against the cops accused of causing her death and the “apathy” of the CID, which they claim is delaying trial in the case.\nOnce considered hunter-gatherers, the Pardhi tribe, to which Suman and her family belonged, had been notified as a ‘criminal tribe’ under the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871 under colonial rule. In 1949, the government of the newly independent India repealed the CTA and in 1952, denotified several ‘criminal tribes’, including the Pardhis, but the stigma stuck, with the community being among the most marginalised in the country.\nSuman Ganjan Kale’s son, Saheba, holds up photos of the ‘Atmasamarpan Melava,’ in which Suman is seen being felicitated by police officers. (Express photo by Chandan Haygunde)\nBack in his greying two-room house, Suman’s brother Girish Chavan holds up an old photo of Suman being felicitated by a senior police officer. The photo is already fading, with parts of it, including half of Suman’s face, peeling and discoloured.\nThe photo is from an ‘Atmasamarpan Melava’ – or a surrender rally – Chavan tells The Indian Express. Keen on helping the tribe shed its ‘criminal tag’, Suman had helped several from the tribe “give up” their life of crime and surrender before the police, even earning accolades for her work.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“She felt bad when innocent people were picked up by the police and started helping cops arrest only those who were actually involved in crimes. This is how she became a police informer,” says Chavan.\nWhat happened that day\nAccording to Saheba, his mother was picked up on the morning of May 12, 2007. She kept asking what she had done wrong, he says.\nWhen he went to the local SP office the next day, he allegedly found that his mother had been detained in connection with a dacoity case.\n“I came to know that police detained my mother illegally on the basis of a false statement given by a woman (they identified as) Astari Chavan, arrested in a dacoity case… Soon, we were told she had taken poison and was admitted to a private hospital,” Saheba, a farmer, says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn May 16 – four days after Suman was first picked up – the family was informed of her death.\n“The cops thrashed her so badly that she died…My mother was not a criminal and always encouraged people to follow the law,” he says.\nBut the police give a different account of events. According to their version, mentioned in court documents, Suman had come into the district SP’s office with her nephew on May 14 – two days after she was allegedly picked up – claiming she had taken “lice pesticide”. To support their claim, the police cited harassment complaints that she had filed against her husband.\nBut a legal inquiry conducted by then sub-divisional magistrate Vikas Pansare rejected this version. Citing forensic and post-mortem records, Pansare’s inquiry report from January 8, 2008 – accessed by The Indian Express – claims that Astari was “made to name Suman Kale in the jewellery dacoity case” by policemen. It also says that Suman had been “inflicted with multiple wounds at the hands of police” between May 13 and 14, 2007, in the “illegal custody of the superintendent of police and his special investigation team.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nDays later, the CID began to investigate the case, and in August 14, 2009 — over two years after Suman’s death — booked seven policemen and a private doctor under IPC sections for abetment of suicide, causing grievous hurt to extract confession and wrongful confinement) among others.\nAll eight were arrested in December 2010 but were eventually released on bail.\nIn the chargesheet filed by the CID in September 2013, the agency claimed that the district police picked up Suman from her home on May 12, 2007, and allegedly tortured her to get her to confess that she possessed stolen gold and that, unable to take the police treatment, she eventually consumed poison.\nThe CID also claimed that in order to cover up the death, the district police took her to a private hospital instead of government one and named the doctor who ran the hospital as an accused.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, Suman’s family refutes the CID’s case, claiming that no poison was detected in a chemical analyser’s report dated September 9, 2007. “If poison was not detected, then how can it be a case of suicide by poisoning? Clearly, the CID’s investigation was wrong,” Chavan says.\nIn January 2021, the Aurangabad Bench directed the trial court to consider the evidence for the offences punishable for murder, destroying evidence and criminal conspiracy at the time of framing charges. It also said that the trial court “is expected to decide the case within six months”.\nAnother photo from the ‘Atmasamarpan Melava,’ shows Suman with police officers. (Special arrangement)\nThe order came on the back of a petition by the family asking for the case to be transferred to the CBI and murder charges to be invoked against the accused.\nOn February 15, 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) filed by some accused for quashing the HC order. However, the biggest blow to the case came in April 2023, when the HC discharged the accused private doctor.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis order came only months after the trial court had rejected a similar application from him. “And the CID did not even inform us (that he was discharged). The CID did not appeal against it in the SC. This is highly suspicious,” Chavan says.\nAccording to Girish Prabhune, a social activist from the Bhatke Vimukta Vikas Parishad and a 2021 Padma Shri awardee, the CID “never took the case seriously”. Prabhune is among those calling for justice in the case.\nWhen asked, CID chief Prashant Burde told The Indian Express that he would “have to check” and that he didn’t have information on the case “off-hand”.\nMeanwhile, unhappy with the case’s progress in courts, Girish sought the help of Vivek Vichar Manch, an outfit that focuses on human rights. He also demanded a Special Public Prosecutor for this case.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe request came through last month, when an SPP was appointed.\n“Those responsible for Suman’s death are under the impression that Pardhis cannot fight for justice. We want to prove them wrong. Which is why it’s important that Suman gets justice, so that Pardhis as a community have more faith in the legal system.”"

        "content": "When 58-year-old Leelavati received a message from Khoda police station in Ghaziabad on Tuesday, telling her they had found her son, she wasn’t too excited.\nOver the last 31 years, she has received over seven such calls from the police, only to return disappointed. Her son Bhim Singh was nine, she says, when he was kidnapped in broad daylight. “I thought it would be a repeat of what happened many times earlier,’’ she recalls. “The police will bring a man in front of me and ask me to identify if he is my son. Every time they called me, I told them (policemen) about the marks on my son’s body. The marks never matched and I would return disappointed.”\nHowever, a small spark of hope remained. “I hardly had any hope of reuniting with my missing son… but then I kept telling myself, ‘what if they had found him?,’’ she says. “I had to go.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nInside Khoda police station, Leelavati covered her head with her blue saree as soon as a man appeared. “He looked at me and shouted… this is my mother,’’ she recalls.\n“I was a bit surprised and didn’t believe him. But when he called me mother again, I was moved to tears,’’ she says. There was another surprise for her though. She gave the policemen details of the marks on her missing son’s body and when they checked, her description matched. “He was indeed my son”.\nBhim is now a grown man. He is 40.\nThe tragic tale of this family, staying in a single-room house on the terrace of a two-storeyed building in Gali no. 6 of Ghaziabad’s Shaheed Nagar, began on September 8, 1993. Bhim, then around 9 years old, was returning from DBS Public school along with his two older sisters, Rajo and Santosh.\nBhim remembers that day vividly. “I remember asking my sister, Rajo, to buy me an umbrella while we were on our way back home. She didn’t want to and we were arguing,’’ he recalls. “Suddenly, a few men encircled me. They picked me up, pushed me into an auto (rickshaw) and drove away”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor Santosh (45) and Rajo (43), that moment is etched in their memory. “He was wearing a white shirt and light blue trousers. We were minutes away from our home, when a group of unknown men took him away,” recalls Santosh.\nAt that time, Rajo and Santosh were 14 and 12 years old respectively. Bhim also had a younger sister, Hema, who was less than a year old at the time. The sisters say they ran back to their home and informed their mother.\n“Their eyes were red. They were shivering and all they said was some people had taken Bhim in an auto. I ran barefoot to the spot. Their father was not home. I kept looking for him the entire day,” recalls Leelavati. “It was an unending trauma… we kept looking for him.”\nAfter 31 years, two months and 19 days, the family was miraculously reunited.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The last time I went to the police station three years ago. That time too my son wasn’t there. But I never lost hope. I knew he would find us one day,” says Leelavati\nWhile Bhim was missing, a lot changed — both his grandparents died, two of his sister got married. “My in-laws had left to go back to their village, Baidpura in Dadri, a year after he was kidnapped. His grandfather died 10 years ago and three years later his grandmother also died,” says Leelavati. “Two of his sisters are already married. We have become old now.”\nIt was Bhim’s younger sister Hema who saw a picture resembling her elder brother in a local daily on September 22. “It was an article about a man who had been missing for a long time and the police were searching for his family to reunite them,’’ Hema says. A relative, who works as a constable in the Ghaziabad Police, asked the family to visit the police station.\nAt Khoda police station –Bhim had already been taken to six different police stations before this — he also recognised his sisters the moment he saw them.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Besides, he had a mole on his right leg, a mark on left ear, a cut mark on his forehead and his hollow shaped head,” Leelavati says.\nBhim’s father, 70-year-old Tularam, however, wants to convince himself further. “We know he is our son. But we will get the DNA test done after December 6 to be sure about it,” he says.\nThe Ghaziabad police had been approaching the family because Bhim’s father had filed a missing person complaint at Mohan Nagar police station on September 9, 1993, a day after the boy was kidnapped. This case was unresolved.\nTwo days after Bhim was kidnapped, the family says, they had received a ransom letter. “We got a letter and his kidnappers demanded Rs 8 lakhs to set him free,” Tula Ram says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile the family was frantically looking for him, Bhim says his nightmare began the moment he was kidnapped. “After taking me away in the auto, the kidnappers subsequently put me in a truck and drove away,’’ he says. The kidnappers, he says, had taken him to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. “Before I could do anything, they chained me outside a hut of a herder,’’ he recalls. “They would make me rear sheep and cows…. milk them… during the day but they would keep me chained at night so that I couldn’t run away”.\nWhen asked if he ever made any attempts to run away, Bhim says he couldn’t.\n“I did not know where to go. For 30 to 40 km around the place, I knew there was no road. People travelled in camel carts. How far could I go on foot?” he says.\nBhim says that his “owner” was a man named Sai Ram who “kept an eye on me all the time”.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Once, a sheep had become so weak that it was not able to stand and died. They beat me badly.. they broke my right hand. My jaw got dislocated, I was scared of them,” he says.\nHow did he escape?\n“A few days ago, I met a truck driver while I was grazing sheep in the afternoon in Jaisalmer,” he says. “I narrated my entire story to him. He rescued me. He wrote all the information that I remembered on a piece of paper. This finally helped me reach Ghaziabad,’’ Bhim recalls. This note mentioned his name, his father’s name and that he is from somewhere in Ghaziabad.\n“The driver dropped me off at a market somewhere in Delhi. From there, with the help of people, I reached Indirapuram Police station in Ghaziabad,” Bhim says.\nHe says that initially he cried a lot. “But now my tears have dried up. I can’t cry anymore.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe says that he always missed his sisters while living in that desert far away. ”We would always play together in the house. I used to hate the fact that Happo would always get more milk to drink,” he smiles.\nBhim had given his own nickname, Happo, to his younger sister Hema – then just a newly born.\nThe sisters say while Bhim was missing, every Raksha Bandhan they would tie a Rakhi to his photo, which was clicked when Bhim was 6 years old.\nBhim, the Ghaziabad Police says, was rescued by a truck driver. “He found him somewhere in Jaisalmer. Bhim narrated the entire incident to the truck driver. This truck driver wrote his information on a paper and helped him reach the police,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ghaziabad, Nimish Patil says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBhim had reached Ghaziabad on November 22. For the next five days, he was taken to several police stations where families of missing children came to check. He had met three other families earlier but had categorically said they are not his family.\n“It is a miracle,’’ Bhim’s father Tularam says. “We are going to teach him to use a mobile phone first and ask him to continue his education. He was in class three then, now he will start studying again.”"

        "content": "Sorgavaasal Movie Review: Prison films are tough to crack, but the allure of this genre is understandable. It is essentially a chamber drama where every character is unpredictable, and the audience is tuned to expect them to get violent at any time. These characters are ticking time bombs, and the setting allows the writers to explore the human psyche and deliver a solid character-driven drama. With this base in place, one can add the required flavours like romance, sentiment, revenge, and even comedy, and a prison film will have the space for it all. What really matters is the proportion of each, and for the longest time in Sorgavaasal, debutant director Sidharth Vishwanath, along with his co-writers Tamizh Prabha and Ashwin Ravichandran, get it right. However, despite perfectly building a Virumaandi meets Vada Chennai narrative to a crescendo, they falter at the end. But the characters, and its effective portrayal, ensure Sorgavaasal escapes without crashing and burning. \nSorgavaasal opens with jailer Kattabomman (Karunaas) saying this was a job he didn’t want to do. It is a job that neither helps him gain respect nor make money with bribes. Then, he lets us know that given a choice between being a servant in heaven and a king in hell, many of us would choose the latter. And who is he telling all of this to? It is investigating officer Ismail (Natty), who is trying to understand the machinations of a bloody prison riot that ended with 45 deaths, and 60 reported missing cases. Through this investigation, we are introduced to the various guards of this not-so-pearly gates of ‘heaven’. \nRJ Balaji in a Still from Sorgavaasal.\nALSO READ: ‘In cinema, people are good to you as long as they think you are below them’: Singapore Saloon actor RJ Balaji\nADVERTISEMENT\nWe have the dreaded gangster Sigamani (a terrific Selvaraghavan), who wants to denounce his ways and walk the path of god, thanks to the words of fellow inmate Kendrick (an effective Samuel Robinson). He has his trusted aides, the hot-headed Tiger Mani (Hakkim) and the calm and non-violent Seelan (Anthonydasan Jesuthasan). It is into this well-organised world inside the prison that a pushcart restaurant owner Parthiban (RJ Balaji in his career-best performance) is thrown in for a crime he didn’t commit. \nSorgavaasal is essentially an insight into the prison system of India, which is burdened by the other systems in place. Ask prison wardens why the jails are overflowing? They’ll point at the justice system. Ask the justice system why prisons aren’t establishments where people change, they’ll point at the conditions in the prison. Ask the government why there aren’t enough funds allocated for the same? They’ll point at both, and the vicious cycle continues. However, it is different on celluloid, right? One can dangle the glimmer of hope. And it is this hope that fuels the life of Parthiban inside the grey walls that close in on him with every passing day. As Cooker Basheer (an excellent Balaji Sakthivel) tells him, “Don’t cook tasty food everyday… you are not supposed to feel at home in a jail.” This sentiment hits us at the core, however, such moments come sparingly in a film that is instead focused on wringing out a dark and gory thriller from a wafer-thin premise. \nHere’s the trailer:\nYes, the characters are engaging, but only a handful get enough emotional heft. Probably why, when all hell breaks loose in the last act featuring the prison riot, we are at an arm’s length from the characters. But till then, Sidharth runs a tight ship, and points to RJ Balaji for not wanting to be at the centre of the narrative at all points. Make no mistake, the film is still about Parthiban, but the movie is also about the other inmates of the prison, and how each of them are just putting on a facade to mask the pain of just surviving a life, and never living it. \nSidharth and Co do a good job of establishing the core of Parthiban using just limited scenes. Take, for instance, the beautiful arc for Parthiban featuring his mother (Porkodi) and fiance (Saniya Iyappan). It gives us pointers about Parthiban’s psyche, and why the police might have been quick to brand him a murderer. However, it never overstays its welcome. There is also a scene in the prison involving Parthiban and his prison friend Rangu (Maurish). Just when a saviour complex creeps in, it is beautifully shut down. Such flourishes are the highlights of Sorgavaasal, which works wonderfully as a character study of people thrown into a life in prison. \nADVERTISEMENT\nA still from Sorgavaasal featuring Saniya Iyappan, RJ Balaji and Maurish.\nInterestingly, Sorgavaasal doesn’t go the Criminal Justice way to gradually tell us about the struggles of being in prison. It briefly touches upon the free-flow of drugs, sexual violence, and cliques in a prison before getting into the core plot of a strict Superintendent (Sharaf U Dheen) trying to bring in order and enforce his superiority among ‘criminals’ lodged inside the prison. His complete disdain for the ‘lowly criminals’ and his manipulative methods to make people do his bidding forms the second act of the film, which augurs well for Sorgavaasal. Even when newer players are brought into the mix, the film never feels bloated because there is something interesting always underway. Since the movie is more Virumaandi than Vada Chennai, we aren’t really bothered by the ‘hows’ or ‘whys’ of the events. We are just witness to a series of events unfolding, and points to the makers for ensuring these are gripping.\nThere aren’t many standout dialogues, and it is mainly because they aren’t designed to be. There is a beautiful conversation about god between Siga and Kendrick where there is a sense of showboating and a lack of subtlety. But it still works because the characters are memorable, and wonderfully portrayed. It all comes together with the brilliant background score of Christo Xavier, who not only delivers on the adrenaline-pumping score when things go haywire, but gives the film much-needed calmness and silence through his work in the not-so-flamboyant portions. Cinematographer Prince Anderson does an excellent job of showing S Jayachandran’s prison set in all its greyness, and devoid of a semblance of hope. The elaborate action sequences in the final act give us a strong feeling of witnessing violence on a grand scale. However, it doesn’t always come across, and the true expanse of the prison isn’t really felt.\nSelvaraghavan with director Sidharth Vishwanath.\nALSO READ: ‘Suriya sir, don’t join electoral politics’ urges RJ Balaji, Karthik Subbaraj praises Kanguva star for ‘not taking stardom and fans for granted’\nAs the credits rolled in Sorgavaasal, and Christo’s ominous score takes centrestage, I couldn’t help but be impressed with how the film doesn’t really take sides. It would have been easy to make the police the antagonists to the prisoners considering Balaji plays one. Since the film isn’t just about Balaji’s character, the decision to step back and just show us the machinations of each provides a lot more insight than nudging us to understand the writers’ intentions. Do you feel bad for Parthiban and other jail inmates? Do you feel bad for Kattabomman, Sunil Kumar and their ilk who are forced to bell the cat? Do you feel bad for the harbingers of justice who are mere smokescreens in the halls of power? It felt like Sorgavaasal reminds us of how simple it is to slip up from our own sheltered lives, because at the end of the day, all of us are mere pawns in a system… a system that thrives in the belief that no one has time to sit and ponder about the ones that are left behind in a path that, more often than not, is less a path, and more a vortex. \nADVERTISEMENT\nSorgavaasal movie director: Sidharth Vishwanathan\nSorgavaasal movie cast: RJ Balaji, Karunaas, Sharaf U Dheen, Selvaraghavan, Saniya Iyappan\nSorgavaasal movie rating: 3 stars"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/from-naples-to-new-york-how-pizza-became-a-fan-favourite-across-the-world-9694518/",
        "content": "Few fast-food dishes have a literary history as illustrious as pizza. From Virgil’s Aeneid to Alexandre Dumas’ Le Corricolo and Pellegrino Artusi’s famed 1890s cookbook La Scienza in Cucina e l’Arte di Mangiar Bene (Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well), pizza has found mention in literature across centuries.\nToday, pizza is one of the most popular foods worldwide in various forms, across cultures. The earliest pizzas were flatbreads with toppings like mushrooms and herbs, but not the tomato sauce and cheese we associate with modern versions. These were sold to those who couldn’t afford plates, with the flatbread doubling as edible dishware. In fact, in Aeneid, shortly after Aeneas and his companions arrive in Latium, they sit beneath a tree and eat “thin wheaten cakes as platters for their meal.” Then, they top them with mushrooms and herbs. They devour every bite, and Aeneas’ son Ascanius exclaims: “Look! We’ve even eaten our plates!”\nThe version of pizza we are familiar with and have grown to love — specifically the thin-crust Neapolitan variety and not the versions topped with momos offered by some fast-food chains––was created in Naples in the late 18th century. During Bourbon rule, Naples became one of Europe’s largest cities, home to a massive number of impoverished peasants. They were called the lazzaroni because their bedraggled appearance made them look like Lazarus. The lazzaroni were porters, messengers and daily labourers who needed cheap, easy-to-carry food — which explains the very spartan toppings. And voila, the pizza was born.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlexandre Dumas mentions this version of pizza in Le Corricolo (1843), and how a two liard slice would be eaten for breakfast. A whole pizza large enough to feed a family could be bought for two sous. None of these pizzas were complicated or gourmet creations. These were topped with just garlic, lard and salt, sometimes they used caciocavallo (cheese made from horse’s milk), cecenielli (whitebait) or basil. This was when tomatoes began being used as a topping. In a way, it was still fast food, meeting the requirements of being easy to eat, quick to cook and priced very low.\nBut, there’s class consciousness even in the world of pizzas. Since pizzas were associated with the lazzarone or poor labourers, cookbooks in the late 19th century never included recipes for pizzas.\nMargherita pizza (Photo: Freepik)\nThat changed dramatically when Queen Margherita of Savoy and King Umberto I visited Naples after Italian unification in 1889. The story goes that Margherita was tired of being served butter-redolent French food for all meals and asked for something simpler. The pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito whipped up three types of pizza. One was topped with lard, caciocavallo, and basil. Another with cecenielli. The third with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. It’s the third one, which was her favourite, which was named pizza Margherita in her honour. It’s a version every child I meet seems to love. And honestly, if you get the sauce right, there are only a few toppings that are as satisfying.\nIt’s after this royal stamp of honour that pizza became accepted as a delicacy. Italian traders and settlers took the pizza to America when they settled in the East Coast. It was way back in 1905 that Lombardi’s––the first pizzeria––opened in New York City. There is, of course, that abomination that I ate in Chicago––the Chicago Deep Dish Pizza––which is a thick dough, has cheese at the bottom, and a massive pile of sauce and toppings.\nADVERTISEMENT\nALSO READ | Deep-fried triangles of spicy goodness: Where did samosa come from?\nGrowing up, my mother made pizza at home using the slightly thick pre-made bases common in India 30 years ago. She topped them with homemade sauce and grated cheese before baking. We loved it. But my appreciation for pizza truly deepened after tasting authentic Italian versions. In Milan and Rome, I encountered large, thin-crust pizzas, freshly rolled and topped with a delicate tomato sauce, basil, Parma ham, and mozzarella slabs. The toppings were always minimal, as was the sauce.\nThe other main difference between pizza in Italy and pizza elsewhere in the world is how it’s eaten. No one in Italy picks up pizzas by hand or sandwiches two slices together. They always cut the slices into pieces with a fork and knife. And here’s my favourite pizza sauce recipe.\nPizza Sauce\nTomatoes: 1 kg, cut in half\nGarlic: 200 gms, peeled\nHandful of fresh herbs – basil and sage, chopped\nChili flakes: 1 tbsp\nSugar: 1 tbsp\nFreshly ground pepper: 1 tbsp\nDried oregano: 1 tbsp\nOnion: 2 large, chopped\nYou can keep this sauce in the fridge for at least 2 weeks. (Photo: Freepik)\nProcess\nPreheat your oven to 180 degrees for 10 minutes. Then place the tomatoes and the garlic and the onion in the oven for 45 mins. The tomato skins should be slightly charred. You can cover the roasting pan with some foil after 20 mins.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRemove the pan from the oven, and peel off the skin of the tomatoes.\nThen puree the tomatoes, onions and garlic together.\nHeat a pan, and add some olive oil. To it add the tomato mixture, herbs and seasoning. Simmer over a low flame till the sauce thickens.\nYou can keep this sauce in the fridge for at least 2 weeks.\nOnce you’ve mastered this sauce, play around with the seasonings, add some celery stalks, different herbs, and more chili.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNext week I’ll be writing about the wonder of “double roti” and some other breads which we’ve made our own in India.\n📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/australia-social-media-ban-challenges-age-verification-9697671/",
        "content": "Australia’s Parliament has passed a new bill that would ban children younger than 16 years old from social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, and X – but there is a long way to go before the ban kicks into effect.\nThe law was passed by the Australian Senate on Friday, November 29, with a vote of 34-19 after the country’s House of Representatives approved the first-of-its-kind legislation by 102 votes to 13 a day prior.\nAs per the legislation, social media companies are liable for fines up to 50 million Australian dollars (Rs 275 crore approx.) if they fail to prevent children under the age of 16 from holding accounts on their platforms.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday. The social media ban has been introduced to mitigate the physical and mental health risks faced by children due to excessive use of social media. It has also been rolled out in response to misogynist content and harmful depictions of body image shown to teenagers on these platforms.\nHowever, the path to implementing the social media ban on children under 16 is dicey.\n“Even though it’s been passed, there has been a lot of debate within Australia about whether a social media ban is the best way to go about addressing these risks,” said Aparajita Bharti, the co-founder of tech policy organisation The Quantum Hub (TQH).\nFirst, what does the law say?\nThe newly approved legislation is titled the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024. While it bans under-16 children from holding a social media account, they are allowed to access these platforms in a “logged out state”. For example, they can visit the Facebook page of a business or service as this does not normally require users to log into the platform.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe onus of keeping age-restricted users out of social media is placed on platforms. Hence, there are no penalties for users or their parents.\nThe legislation requires platforms to take “reasonable steps” to ensure that the minimum age requirement is met but does not specify these measures. “Whether an age assurance methodology meets the ‘reasonable steps’ test is to be determined objectively, having regard to the suite of methods available, their relative efficacy, costs associated with their implementation, and data and privacy implications on users, amongst other things,” the legislation reads.\nAlso Read | Is your child safe online? A handy E-safety guide for every parent\nAs far as the scope of the law is concerned, it states that the minimum age obligation is only for “age-restricted social media platforms” which has been defined by drawing on the existing meaning of “social media service” in the country’s Online Safety Act.\nMessaging apps, online gaming services, and platforms that are primarily used for health and education purposes are to be exempted from the ban. However, the law does not make an exception for age-restricted users who have the consent of their parents or carers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo ensure user privacy, the legislation requires platforms to only use the information collected for age assurance and nothing else – unless the user gives clear, informed consent to do so. Platforms are also required to delete the data collected after a user’s age has been assured. Additionally, platforms cannot ask Australians to give their government-issued IDs for age assurance.\nWhy is Australia’s social media ban flawed?\nWith the law now having been passed, attention has shifted towards the challenges in its implementation. Stating that children are adept at finding ways to circumvent restrictions on internet and social media access, Bharti said, “I’ve heard of kids using Google Docs to do things they want to do on social media because they want to go around their parents. In that sense, it might put children at more risk as you wouldn’t know what platform they are using and whom to regulate.”\nAustralia’s social media ban could also have a disproportionate impact on youth from marginalised groups who rely on social media to connect with others and access information. “In cases of rape, abuse or trauma, support for victims may come from social media and it could be detrimental to them if you cut them off from these platforms,” said Pallavi Bedi, a senior policy researcher at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS).\nAlso Read | As Australia becomes first country to ban social media for kids under 16, a psychologist reflects on the move\nBharti further emphasised that policy meant to protect children from online harm should be sensitive to the socio-economic context of the country and the nuances of how people interact with technology such as device sharing.\nADVERTISEMENT\nReferring to the situation in India, she cited a TQH survey of 5,000 children from low-income households in Delhi, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand. According to the survey, over 70 per cent of the children said that they use their parents’ phone to access social media while 80 per cent of them help their parents to navigate online.\nHow feasible are age-verification methods?\nSeveral methods exist to verify a user’s age but nearly all of them come with drawbacks. Self-disclosure is easy to circumvent as users are just required to tick a box stating that they are above the minimum age. ID-based verification, on the other hand, raises privacy risks and could put an end to online anonymity which is said to make the internet what it is.\nMeanwhile, Instagram’s ‘Teen Accounts’ require ‘social vouching’ where three of the user’s followers need to vouch that they are not under the minimum age. However, this method is only effective if users already have accounts on the platform. Estimating age based on user behaviour also suffers from the same flaw.\nGiven these limitations, there has been a shift away from age verification towards age estimation and age assurance. Instead of platforms knowing for sure that a user is of a certain age, they can use tools that estimate a user’s age in order to simply indicate whether they are above or below the threshold. Similarly, age assurance methods are used to indicate whether the user falls within the age-restricted bracket or not.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHighlighting a French company’s new tool that can estimate a person’s age based on their hand movements, Bharti said, “There is a lot of innovation happening in the age-verification tech space, and the reason for innovation is because everyone recognises that ID-based verification is not the best.”\nThe Australian government has also roped in tech companies and software testers to conduct a trial on age-gating technology. The trial will see participation from over 1,200 randomly chosen Australians between January to March next year, according to a report by Reuters.\nWhile the purpose of the trial is to determine how the social media ban will be enforced in the country, the government has been criticised for rushing the new legislation through parliament before the outcomes of the trial are known.\nInstead of rushing legislation through parliament without meaningful consultation or a senate inquiry, the government needs to prioritise privacy reform, and at least wait to see the outcome of the $6.5million age assurance trial.\n— Digital Rights Watch (@DRWaus) November 21, 2024"

        "content": "We do not understand how sedentary living affects us till we hit the middle ages. As we age, we lose our muscle mass. But if we lead inactive lives, then that loss accelerates, making us prone to all sorts of diseases.\nThis has been proven by a recent research in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, which shows a massive decline in muscle strength and size among sedentary subjects, aged 60 and above, compared to active ones. From the third decade of life, muscle strength and mass dropped dramatically for sedentary individuals as opposed to active individuals (defined as at least 150 minutes of activity per week) across one’s lifespan. This means half of the strength and size from the peak of the third decade of life to the sixth decade of life is lost for sedentary individuals, affecting their daily activities and making them vulnerable to chronic diseases. Active individuals, on the other hand, retained almost all of their physical function even in their ninth decade of life. In other words, a better quality of life.\nAlso Read | Turning 30? You must take these three tests to prevent heart disease\nWith the loss of muscle mass and strength, we lose physical function (lack of independence to walk and climb stairs), loss of basal energy expenditure (muscle is an energy-hungry tissue; thus, less of it implies weight gain), loss of bone tissue and joint strength, increasing risk of fractures and disability from a fall.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTHE RIGHT WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT\nThe good news is that a drop in muscle and bone mass is a modifiable risk factor and exercise can take care of it. But that weight loss should come from fat tissue. A typical trend during weight loss is that the body also compromises on muscle maintenance because its first priority is getting energy for survival. So in a situation of an energy deficit created to lose weight, muscle protein synthesis is reduced and muscle protein breakdown is increased. How do we stop it?\nTAKE PROTEINS THE RIGHT WAY\n1) Keeping our overall protein intake to a higher range of 1.6-2.2 g/kg of body weight.\n2) Consuming dietary protein sources rich in an amino acid known as leucine which promotes muscle protein synthesis.\nAlso Read | Heart attack among techies in 30s: How overwork, 70-hour week and stress can damage your heart\n3) Doing resistance training at least three times a week.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDoing all three things with 30 g of protein per meal vs. 15 g per meal maximises gains. Protein pacing involves eating about four high protein meals at regular intervals throughout the day, with three to five hour gaps. These lend satiety and kill hunger pangs and ensure even distribution of proteins. These should be from high-quality sources such as lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes and protein supplements (only for those who need it).\nHigher protein intake in meals over time can have effects similar to diabetes and weight loss drugs. In most cases, the solutions to weight loss and diabetes are rooted in our nutrition. Unfortunately, many opt for costly medications instead of making sustainable diet changes.\n(Thakkar is functional medicine expert)"

On Thursday, Shinde had told reporters in Delhi that a Mahayuti meeting on government formation would be held on Friday morning.\n“Our leader is unhappy and so are we.

        "content": "Air India pilot Srishti Tuli, 25, who allegedly died by suicide on November 25, had made a video call to her friend Aditya Rakesh Pandit, 27, before taking the extreme step. Investigators suspect that after the couple’s fight when Pandit left for Delhi, she threatened him saying she would commit suicide, but as he was not paying heed, she made a video call showing him how she was going to hang herself, sources in the police department told The Indian Express.\nPointing out that Pandit was trying to hide something, the source said he allegedly deleted some of the chats with Tuli. When police asked him about the deleted messages, Pandit claimed that he told her that he would also commit suicide if she dies. Police are not buying his claims and are trying to recover the deleted messages with the help of forensic experts, the source added.\nThere were around 10-11 phone calls between the two besides several missed calls on Tuli’s phone while he was going back to her place, as claimed by him, to stop her from taking the extreme step, police said adding they have seized Pandit’s phone.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTuli was found dead at her rented accommodation behind Marol Police Camp in Andheri (East) early Monday. Initial inquiries indicate that she was mentally disturbed due to Pandit’s harassment, police said. Pandit had been preparing for a pilot’s exam but failed to qualify, they added.\nPreliminary police probe has revealed that when Tuli returned home after work on Sunday, she had an argument with Pandit. Around 1 am, Pandit reportedly left for Delhi. Tuli called him on his phone and allegedly told him that she was going to take the extreme step. According to police, Pandit then returned to her place but found the door locked from inside. He called a locksmith, got the room opened, and found her unresponsive, officers said.\nPandit rushed her to Seven Hills Hospital in Marol, where Tuli was declared dead. Soon her family and police were informed. As per preliminary investigation, the fight between the duo triggered the young pilot to take the extreme step.\nWhen police asked Pandit about the reason behind their fight, he claimed that she was forcing him to stay for a few days but he decided to leave. Police are trying to verify this from their chats and messages.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPolice have informed Pandit’s mother Anjali Pandit, 53, about her son’s arrest on the complaint of Tuli’s family and the charges police have pressed against him.\nAnother police source said that Pandit was arrested as he failed to inform police about Tuli’s threats to commit suicide over phone call and messages. Even when he found her residence locked from inside, he got a locksmith to open it, without informing the police. Also he was the last person with whom the deceased woman spoke to. All these indicate his possible role behind her suicide, the source said.\nPandit has been arrested under section 109 of the Bhartiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) and would be produced in the court on Friday for the second time to seek his custody for further investigation, police said."

        "content": "Written by Nitesh Jain\nPicture your neighbourhood British pub. It’s centuries old and feels like it. The polished wood interiors with overstuffed leather seating. The dim light from charmingly antique light fixtures. The boring but supple carpet. There are no surprises here — decent beer, not-so-decent food. Most importantly: Unassuming, no-frills patrons. The pub is a reassuring, fixed point in an uncertain universe.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut sales are withering, and the old regulars are dying off. One day, after months of renovations, the place reopens. It’s in the same location, has the same name. But it’s unrecognisable: A cocktail bar with snazzy lighting and Instagram-worthy nooks. Gone are the Sunday roast, shepherd’s pie and fish & chips. There’s global cuisine now, all of it made from locally sourced ingredients. And a separate vegan menu. The joint wants to be more inclusive, and there are pride flags on the storefront windows. They’re angling for a whole new clientele, one who would never consider stopping by here earlier.\nWill the gambit work?\nJaguar has had an eventful corporate history. From making the most beautiful post-war car (The E-Type), to being absorbed, nationalised, spun off and cast away, it has endured apathy, neglect and borderline abuse. (Looking at you now, Ford). The 2008 Tata Motors acquisition was promising, but even here Jaguar was quickly overshadowed by its more successful SUV cousin, Land Rover. This wasn’t Tata’s fault, just a sign of the times: The market wanted big SUVs, not low super saloons or little sports cars.\nIt wasn’t all gloom and doom, though. There was a promising design revival led by Ian Callum, and sales peaked in 2018 at 1,80,000 units. Jaguar beat most competitors to launch the first mainstream conceived-electric luxury car: the I-Pace. It even won the 2019 World Car of the Year award. So naturally, Jaguar let it wither on the vine. No updates, no support and massive component shortages (pre-Covid!).\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the past, patrons put up with Jaguar’s notorious reliability for its image — the cheeky, broke heir whose charm always lets him get away with being a cad. You’d be forgiving too, if you saw one of these beauties in British racing green on the showroom floor. And the roar from the engine would dispel any doubts that remained.\nIn 2021, after years of losses, Jaguar announced plans to go all electric in four years. The plug was pulled on the next generation of its flagship: The XJ. All IC engine development was suspended. This was probably for the best. The old, fire-breathing supercharged V6s and V8s had given way to the anaemic Ingenium family of engines. Jaguar had devolved from Bentley-lite to a shoddy Audi-BMW-Merc clone.\nMaybe going electric could save it. But electric cars have an inherent problem: They lack soul. Designed to be as aerodynamic as possible, all EVs start to look alike — ungainly blobs with ugly wheels. The weight of the batteries makes sharp handling near-impossible. Only Porsche has come close to cracking that puzzle. And no engine means no roar. What does a silent Jag even stand for?\nIn this context, Jaguar’s controversial rebrand makes sense. Like our pub, it can no longer survive on its dwindling erstwhile patrons. It has missed the starting gun on luxury or tech as a differentiator. It cannot beat the Chinese on cost. And so, like any good luxury brand, it has decided to embrace image as identity. Jaguar will be an inclusive, fashion-forward, planet-positive marque. It will be aspirational, and speak to a far younger audience, embracing individuality and acceptance.\nIt is fascinating that, until recently, this position was occupied by Tesla. With Elon Musk’s recent rightward drift, a space has opened up exactly where Jaguar is positioning itself. This is entirely unintentional, as Jaguar’s language and tagline were decided quite a while back, pre-dating Musk’s ideological fluidity. For once, Jaguar has lucked out.\nMOST READ\n1\nThe JEE system is broken. Here’s how India can produce employable engineers\n2\nNovember 29, 1984, Forty Years Ago: A R Antulay expelled from Congress\n3\nPratap Bhanu Mehta writes: Why Opposition’s ‘democracy in danger’ pitch cuts little ice with voters\n4\nIndia, a leader on the world stage\n5\nMandir, masjid, and Constitution: At Sambhal, a promise betrayed\nIt isn’t going to be an easy path though. The liberal community is accepting, inclusive and trusting, to the point of naivete. It has endured years of poorly designed and shoddily built Teslas. It does not, however, like being patronised. If there is even a whiff of the performative, Jaguar will be cancelled immediately. And since it has abandoned its old identity, there’s no going back there either.\nHere’s the bottom line, Jaguar: The colourful ads with dated images and iffy logo changes aren’t going to suffice. Do not treat this as a quick photo-op at your local Pride Parade. Be an actual ally. Since you’ve chosen your lane, stick to it now. Embrace these values even if it means giving up large chunks of your old demographic. Above all, learn to listen. Surely, you know what it feels like to not be heard in your own home.\nThe writer is a Bangalore-based entrepreneur who also writes about business, finance and startups"

        "content": "Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta, whose petition asking for a survey of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah was admitted by a local court on Wednesday, runs an organisation that has in the past been linked to the defacement of signboards in the national capital, holding a havan for Donald Trump’s victory, the assault of Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, and the targeting of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s Delhi residence.\nOn Wednesday, the court issued notices to the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Archaeological Survey of India, and the Ajmer Dargah Committee, and listed the matter for December 20.\nGupta, 40, was born in Etah, Uttar Pradesh, and moved to Delhi at a young age. He joined the Shiv Sena’s youth wing as a student, and became part of the Bajrang Dal in 2008.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 2011, he and some others founded the Hindu Sena, an organisation that he claims has “lakhs of members” now, with units in “almost all parts of India”.\nOn its website, the Hindu Sena says it “aims to oppose the Islamisation in any form, Sharia law implementation, love jihad and Islamic extremism in India”, and that it would “highlight and protest and take legal action against any person/entity causing harm to the sovereignty of India and Sanatana Dharma”.\nHis petition in Ajmer is the not the first time he or his outfit have knocked on the court’s doors. In 2022, a Bench led by the then Supreme Court Judge, Justice D Y Chandrachud, rejected an intervention application filed by Gupta in May that year, seeking dismissal of the petition filed by Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Management Committee, which had challenged the videographic survey of the Gyanvapi Mosque complex in Varanasi.\nIn February 2023, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and M M Sundresh dismissed a petition by the Hindu Sena seeking a ban on the BBC for its documentary on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the 2002 Gujarat riots, calling it “completely misconceived”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn April 2024, the Delhi High Court rejected a petition filed by the Hindu Sena seeking the removal of Arvind Kejriwal from the post of Chief Minister following his arrest.\nHe and his outfit have also faced several police cases. Asked about these, Gupta said, “I don’t know how many FIRs have been lodged against me. Ab koi chor batayega humne kitni chori kari hai? (Will a thief tell you how much he has stolen?).”\nIn October 2011, an FIR was lodged against Gupta and BJP’s Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga for allegedly assaulting Bhushan at his chamber in the court. Gupta was subsequently arrested by the Delhi Police. In October 2015, he was arrested for allegedly giving false information about beef being served at Delhi’s Kerala House.\nIn June 2017, an FIR was lodged against Gupta and Hindu Sena members, allegedly for barging into the CPM headquarters in Delhi and manhandling party general secretary Sitaram Yechury.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn November 2020, a case was lodged against Gupta following a complaint by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation for allegedly defacing the signboard of the India Islamic Cultural Centre and pasting a poster that read Jihadi Terrorist Islamic Centre.\nIn September 2021, five members of Hindu Sena were arrested for allegedly vandalising the residence of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi.\nIn June 2022, the Hindu Sena allegedly organised an event at Vishwagiri temple in Rajouri Garden and held a “sword distribution” in support of Nupur Sharma following her suspension by the BJP for alleged objectionable comments on the Prophet. A complaint was filed before the National Commission for Minorities.\nIn August 2023, the Delhi Police stopped a mahapanchyat organised by the Hindu Sena, including Gupta, at Jantar Mantar for alleged inflammatory speeches with references to communal violence in Haryana’s Nuh.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe and his outfit have also been in the news for allegedly defacing the signboards of Akbar Road and Feroz Shah Road in Delhi; vandalising the office of Pakistan International Airlines; protesting the then Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Pakistan in 2016; organising a havan to ensure the victory of Trump in the presidential election the same year; amd throwing ink on J&K MLA Engineer Rashid in 2021."

        "content": "The general elections of 2024 witnessed the unfortunate pitting of Jai Shri Ram against Jai Samvidhan, which perhaps captures the broader ongoing tussle between civilisation and Constitution in the Bharatiya context. While some may be tempted to dismiss this as a tussle manufactured by cynical political stakeholders, in my view, in this part of the world, the relationship between civilisation and constitution has been an uneasy one. The reason for this uneasiness could be that political decolonisation — “independence” — did not lead to much-needed decolonisation of the Bharatiya psyche and consciousness. On the contrary, alongside the process of political decolonisation, the “independent” Indian state may have actively entrenched colonial thought as part of its politico-constitutional framework and everything else which is downstream of that. This continuity of thought and attitude from the coloniser to post-colonial India explains, in many ways, the tensions that animate the equation between the civilisational identity of the Indian subcontinent (not “South Asia”) and the Indian Constitution.\nSimply put, in independent India, colonial condescension went on to don the cloak of constitutional morality whose purpose has been to reform the native identity out of its existence with the aid of allegedly immutable preambular values such as secularism. The net result has been that independent India has done more to sever itself from its roots than the coloniser’s own systematic attempts at rendering it rootless. That this state of affairs is treated as the continuing fulfilment of the vision of the framers of the Constitution and a condition precedent for material prosperity tells the story of independent India’s self-perception. To add to this, any talk of decolonisation is dubbed communal, exclusionary and anti-Constitution with renewed vows of fealty to the Constitution and its supposed Basic Structure which, we are told, is here to stay for eternity. We are also told that the only Constitutionally-compliant variant of nationalism that is acceptable is civic nationalism, which is founded on secular civic values and allegiance to the Constitution.\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "Do social media users truly understand what they are signing up for? This question might be asked following a curious turn of events at the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in the US. The purchase of the website InfoWars by satirical news outlet, The Onion, has come up against the Elon Musk-owned X, which seeks to prevent InfoWars’ accounts on its platform from being included in the sale. The company has cited its terms of services establishing its “superior control over and ownership of all X accounts”. Such a clause is by no means unusual in terms of services across social media platforms, but it’s little known to users and is rarely enforced.\nTerms of services are notoriously hard to comprehend and few people bother beyond clicking “accept”, but the question has a larger resonance at a time when social media’s role in politics and society is under greater scrutiny. The world has travelled far from the moment in 2004 when MySpace got to one million monthly active users and marked the beginning of social media as it is understood today. In the 20 years since, the misty-eyed view of thriving online communities with unimpeded access to knowledge has come up against harsh realities like depleted attention spans, higher levels of anxiety and dis- and misinformation. Highly-publicised cases, like the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, have revealed how tech companies risk user privacy or knowingly ignore harmful content. Regulators around the world are now taking action — the latest example being Australia’s law to ban social media for children below 16. This, even as platforms themselves begin to take proactive measures, like TikTok restricting beauty filters for users below 13 and Instagram’s “teen accounts”, where parents can manage their children’s handles. But concerns about the power of these platforms are not easily allayed: Consider the controversy over Elon Musk’s alleged use of X in shaping public opinion in the US presidential election — which is likely to be exacerbated by X’s intervention in the sale of the conspiracy theory-driven InfoWars.\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "Sorgavaasal Movie Review: Prison films are tough to crack, but the allure of this genre is understandable. It is essentially a chamber drama where every character is unpredictable, and the audience is tuned to expect them to get violent at any time. These characters are ticking time bombs, and the setting allows the writers to explore the human psyche and deliver a solid character-driven drama. With this base in place, one can add the required flavours like romance, sentiment, revenge, and even comedy, and a prison film will have the space for it all. What really matters is the proportion of each, and for the longest time in Sorgavaasal, debutant director Sidharth Vishwanath, along with his co-writers Tamizh Prabha and Ashwin Ravichandran, get it right. However, despite perfectly building a Virumaandi meets Vada Chennai narrative to a crescendo, they falter at the end. But the characters, and its effective portrayal, ensure Sorgavaasal escapes without crashing and burning. \nSorgavaasal opens with jailer Kattabomman (Karunaas) saying this was a job he didn’t want to do. It is a job that neither helps him gain respect nor make money with bribes. Then, he lets us know that given a choice between being a servant in heaven and a king in hell, many of us would choose the latter. And who is he telling all of this to? It is investigating officer Ismail (Natty), who is trying to understand the machinations of a bloody prison riot that ended with 45 deaths, and 60 reported missing cases. Through this investigation, we are introduced to the various guards of this not-so-pearly gates of ‘heaven’. \nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "Few fast-food dishes have a literary history as illustrious as pizza. From Virgil’s Aeneid to Alexandre Dumas’ Le Corricolo and Pellegrino Artusi’s famed 1890s cookbook La Scienza in Cucina e l’Arte di Mangiar Bene (Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well), pizza has found mention in literature across centuries.\nToday, pizza is one of the most popular foods worldwide in various forms, across cultures. The earliest pizzas were flatbreads with toppings like mushrooms and herbs, but not the tomato sauce and cheese we associate with modern versions. These were sold to those who couldn’t afford plates, with the flatbread doubling as edible dishware. In fact, in Aeneid, shortly after Aeneas and his companions arrive in Latium, they sit beneath a tree and eat “thin wheaten cakes as platters for their meal.” Then, they top them with mushrooms and herbs. They devour every bite, and Aeneas’ son Ascanius exclaims: “Look! We’ve even eaten our plates!”\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "Observing that the benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks, a Supreme Court-appointed panel has backed setting up five hydroelectric projects (HEPs) on the Ganga and its tributaries in Uttarakhand — even as the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) and Jal Shakti Ministry opposed the projects. The ministries had raised apprehensions ranging from impact on rivers not being taken into account to the projects falling in landslide or seismic zones.\nThe top court has been examining the question of starting new HEPs on the Ganga since 2013, in a suo motu case it took up following the Kedarnath floods that killed over 5,000 people.\nInitially, the court put a moratorium on granting clearances for any new HEPs, and asked the MoEF to form a committee to first study the impact of such projects. Since then, the ministry has formed three committees:\nADVERTISEMENT\n📌 The first one, led by environmentalist Ravi Chopra, concluded in 2014 that HEPs exacerbated the disaster. It also recommended not going ahead with 24 proposed projects.\n📌 After six HEP proponents moved the Supreme Court for permission to resume their projects, the ministry formed a second committee in 2015 under IIT-Kanpur’s Vinod Tare. This panel  found that the six projects had prior clearances but would pose serious ecological impacts.\n📌 Then, a third committee formed under engineer B P Das recommended in 2020 that 28 projects be given a nod.\nHowever, the Centre decided in 2021 that just seven of these 28 projects, on which work had already begun, be given the go-ahead. This came on the back of a meeting held in the Prime Minister’s Office chaired by the Principal Secretary to the PM.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn August 8 this year, the Supreme Court asked the Centre why it had allowed only seven projects. It also formed a high-level committee, headed by Cabinet Secretary T V Somanathan, to revisit the B P Das committee report and decide the fate of the other 21 HEPs.\nAlso Read | Why locals are protesting against the Upper Siang hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh\nThis panel, in a report submitted to the court on November 8, gave a go-ahead to five projects — Bowala Nandprayag (300 MW on Alaknanda river), Devasri (252 MW on Pinder river), Bhyundar Ganga (24.3 MW), Jhalakoti (12.5 MW) and Urgam-II (7.5 MW).\nApart from Somanathan, this panel had four others — secretaries of the Environment, Power and Jal Shakti ministries, and the Chief Secretary of Uttarakhand.\nThe panel took into account concerns raised by the Environment and Jal Shakti ministries but concluded that there is no clear-cut evidence to establish affinity between HEP structures and landslides. It noted that there might be some adverse impacts of the five projects proposed for recommendation, but added that their benefits outweigh the drawbacks and it serves the national interest to give them a nod.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Jal Shakti ministry’s key criticism was that the BP Das committee did not account for the cumulative impact of the projects on Alaknanda, Bhilangana and Dhauliganga rivers.\nThe environment ministry was of the view that issues such as landslides, flash floods, glacial lake outburst floods and seismic activities had not been considered by the committee even as they had a significant impact on the region’s fragile ecology.\nThe ministry highlighted that most of the 28 projects recommended were in vulnerable landslide zones and fell under seismic zone IV or V. It also pointed out that recent disasters such as Joshimath flash floods, Chamoli earthquake and Joshimath land subsidence occurred around project sites.\nIn Explained | What is the Punjab-Himachal dispute over the Shanan hydropower project\nWhile it gave its go-ahead for five projects, the Somanathan committee was not in favour of the remaining 15. It ruled out seven because they fell in the path of areas vulnerable to glacial lake outburst floods. The other eight were ruled due to their impact on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the November 13 hearing, the Centre sought and was granted eight weeks to “place the final decision” before the top court after examining the BP Das committee’s report.\nThe Environment and Jal Shakti ministries did not respond to calls seeking a comment."

        "content": "A young girl with big dreams, who wanted to study for as long as the family could afford it — this is how 16-year-old Sailaja’s brother remembers her.\n“She made our father promise that he would not insist on her getting married until she completes higher education. She used to talk about science and engineering courses,” says C Navneet, her brother.\nHer dreams came crashing after she got food poisoning at the government-run residential school where she was studying — in Wankidi Mandal in Telangana’s Komaram Bheem Asifabad district.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSailaja with her brother\nShe was among 60 students to have fallen ill after lunch on October 28 at the ST Ashram School, run by the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS). After a month of hospitalisation, she died on November 25.\nTSWREIS runs 268 residential educational institutions that cater to students from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Backward Classes, and minority communities. The schools are under intense scrutiny after the deaths of 49 students over the course of this year — 30 from suicide, five due to food poisoning, and 14 because of other illnesses.\nBut it is Sailaja’s death that has perhaps shaken the system the most, with Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy, who also holds the education portfolio, pulling up District Collectors and education officers.\nAlso Read | KTR says District Collector acting like Congress worker, Telangana IAS bodies hit back\nThe state government has ordered the setting up of committees to address incidents of food poisoning even as two Telangana ministers claimed the deaths were linked to a conspiracy hatched by the opposition BRS.\nADVERTISEMENT\n‘Complaints earlier too’\nChoudhary Tukaram, Sailaja’s father, accuses her school of negligence. He says that after several students started vomiting on October 28, the school took them to the hospital without informing the parents immediately.\n“There were complaints earlier, too, about the quality of food. As my daughter’s condition worsened, they took her the next day to Mancherial government hospital and called us at 3 pm. Two days later, they moved her to NIMS (Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences), Hyderabad. She died after battling for her life for 17 days. She was in class 9,” says Tukaram, a resident of Bada village. He is a farmer with two acres of land where he grows cotton and corn alternatively.\nSailaja is among a handful of girls from the Mali community, which comes under category D of the Backward Classes list in the state, to go to school. “We lost a bright girl from our community to the school’s negligence,” Tukaram says.\nFour other students from TSWREIS schools have died of food poisoning — C Prashant from the SC Welfare School in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district (April 17); G Aditya from the Boys Model School in Jagtial district (July 7); Gangotri from the Tribal Ashram School, Adilabad (October 27); and Thodasam Maheshwari, also from Adilabad school (February 29).\nADVERTISEMENT\nAn official from the Directorate of School Education said cooks and food servers were not following standard operating procedures. “Rules, procedures, and guidelines have been issued for food to be prepared under hygienic conditions. However, some people do not follow these, which leads to food poisoning incidents,” the official said.\nOn the large number of suicide deaths, an official said there were many reasons behind it, with loneliness being a key one.\nOn Wednesday, a 14-year-old died by suicide in his hostel room. He had recently been admitted at Maddanapur Residential School for Boys in Wanaparthy district.\nAlso Read | MoEF, Jal Shakti said no, but panel tells SC 5 hydro projects on Ganga are good to go\n“On Tuesday, the boy called up his father and asked him to take him away as he had suffered a minor injury while playing kabbadi. His father tried to counsel him to stay as he had only recently joined the school, but the boy was adamant. His father promised to send his uncle in a few days to fetch him, but the boy took the extreme step the next morning,” said inspector Shekar Reddy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPolitics over deaths\nEven as the CM issued a strong response following Sailaja’s death, his party has indulged in politicking.\nOn Thursday, Reddy pulled up District Collectors and Education Department officials and asked them to “treat the students as your own”.\nThe Telangana government also ordered the setting up of two panels — an institution-level food safety committee and a task force committee.\nBut Telangana Women and Child Welfare Minister D Anasuya and BC Welfare Minister Ponnam Prabhakar said on Friday that there was a conspiracy, allegedly by the opposition BRS, behind the food poisoning cases in residential schools and hostels.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Some of the employees in these residential schools and hostels have connections with the BRS. We strongly suspect that they are sabotaging the food preparation and distribution. To defame the Congress government, they are playing politics with the lives of schoolchildren. Why are these incidents happening in spite of giving clear instructions and guidelines on preparing food in hygienic places? Who are these people who are violating the rules? They will be identified and will be dealt with as per the law,” Anasuya claimed.\nPrabhakar said the number of food poisoning incidents indicated a conspiracy. “Sinister forces are at work to defame our government. Some of the employees in the residential schools and hostels are related to BRS leaders. Our suspicion is on them for spoiling the meals of children. We are in the process of identifying them and we will deal with them,” he said.\nAlso Read | Legal matter between private party & US: Govt on Adani indictment\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, BRS leader Dasoju Sravan denied the allegations, saying the Congress government was trying to cover up the issue.\n“It is insane, inhuman, and callous of Congress ministers to link food poisoning with employees allegedly close to BRS leaders. They are miserably trying to cover up a lack of regular inspections of kitchens and food quality checks. If food poisoning is linked to employees with BRS links, what about the huge number of suicides? This is heights of stupidity and lack of empathy, because all these students are from the marginalised classes,” Sravan said."

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed his country will “invariably support” Russia’s war in Ukraine as he met Russia’s defense chief, the North’s state media reported Saturday.\nA Russia military delegation led by Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in North Korea on Friday, amid growing international concern about the two countries’ expanding cooperation after North Korea sent thousands of troops to Russia last month.\nThe official Korean Central News Agency said that Kim and Belousov reached “a satisfactory consensus” on boosting strategic partnership and defending each country’s sovereignty, security interests and international justice in the face of the rapidly-changing international security environments in a Friday meeting.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKim said that North Korea “will invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the imperialists’ moves for hegemony,” KCNA said.North Korea has supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a defensive response to what both Moscow and Pyongyang call NATO’s “reckless” eastward advance and U.S.-led moves to stamp out Russia’s position as a powerful state.\nAlso read | Military tensions rise as Chinese, Russian planes enter South Korea’s air defence zone\nKim slammed a U.S. decision earlier in November to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles as a direct intervention in the conflict. He called recent Russian strikes on Ukraine “a timely and effective measure” demonstrate Russia’s resolve, KCNA said.\nAccording to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia and some of them have already begun engaging in combat on the frontlines. U.S., South Korean and others say North Korea has also shipped artillery systems, missiles and other conventional weapons to replenish Russia’s exhausted weapons inventory.\nBoth North Korea and Russia haven’t formally confirmed the North Korean troops’ movements, and have steadfastly denied reports of weapons shipments. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners are concerned that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLast week, South Korean national security adviser Shin Wonsik told a local SBS TV program that that Seoul assessed that Russia has provided air defense missile systems to North Korea. He said Russia also appeared to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North’s efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system.\nBelousov also met North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol on Friday. During a dinner banquet later the same day, Belousov said the the two countries’ strategic partnership was crucial to defend their sovereignty from aggression and the arbitrary actions of imperialists, KCNA said.\nIn June, Kim and Putin signed a treaty requiring both countries to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It’s considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War."

        "content": "In a heart-wrenching revelation, Madhu Chopra, mother of actor Priyanka Chopra, shared her emotional journey of sending Priyanka to a boarding school at the tender age of seven. Madhu Chopra, who had always been very close to her daughter, made the difficult decision to send Priyanka to La Martiniere in Lucknow in the hopes of providing her with better education and opportunities.\n“I don’t know if it was a good decision. Now, retrospectively, I do regret, but at that time I thought that I was doing the right thing and it all turned out to be good, it’s fine. But I still tear up thinking about sending that little baby. She was our only child for a long time. She was very prized, very cherished, very loved,” Madhu Chopra said in an interview with Something Bigger Show, her voice filled with emotion.\n  View this post on Instagram\n  A post shared by Priyanka (@priyankachopra)\nMadhu also shared an anecdote that made her feel like she was not a good parent to Priyanka. She shared, “One afternoon, Chopra (Ashok Chopra, husband) was coming back from work, and I was in the kitchen warming up the food… He asked Priyanka, ‘Can you tell your mum I have to go back in a hurry? Can I have a glass of water first then we’ll sit for lunch.’ She said, ‘Can’t you see I am busy?’ She was playing with her dolls. I heard her say that, and I was like, ‘Oh my god she is mimicking me.’ That’s what I used to tell her when I was writing my patients’ documents and writing all that. So I would say, ‘Can’t you see I am busy now? I’ll get back to you later!’ That’s exactly the same tone, the same words she repeated to dad. And I was in the kitchen, ‘Uh oh, I am not a good parent and somewhere I am going wrong.’”\nMadhu also revealed that her husband was not in favour of sending Priyanka to a boarding school, and the decision caused tension in their relationship. “For me, it was meant to be for her better. I thought I was failing as a parent. She was a good student, so we took her to school, La Martiniere, Lucknow. She gave the entrance test, she aced it, and we got the call, and then I told my husband… He was upset to another level, we did not have a normal conversation for a year. But he said, ‘Your decision, the outcome is yours.’”\n  View this post on Instagram\n  A post shared by Priyanka (@priyankachopra)\nThe experience of sending Priyanka to a boarding school was not just difficult for Madhu, but also for her daughter. “Anyway, she went there, she didn’t know she was going to be in a boarding school. She thought she was going to a big school now. We took her there…uff, I still tear up, took her to her dormitory, and the matron came and said that it was time for all the parents to go. Priyanka said, ‘Why are you leaving? Am I not leaving with you?’, and I said, ‘No babe this is going to be your new school, new bed, and friends, and mom will come and see you…’ She was not mentally prepared, psychologically, there was no counseling, nothing. It was very… I don’t know whether I was a mean mother. I still regret it and cry over it. It was very hard for me too.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMadhu would visit Priyanka every Saturday, but the frequent visits were disrupting her daughter’s adjustment to boarding school life. “The thing was, every Saturday I would leave from work, take a train, and visit her every Saturday. That was becoming disruptive for her because she was not able to adjust to her boarding school. Saturdays she would wait for me to arrive, and then on Sunday, I’d stay with her, and then all week… The teacher told me to stop coming. It was one regretful decision, but Priyanka turned out alright. She landed on her feet. When she was in seventh grade, we brought her back.”\nAlso read – Priyanka Chopra: ‘My childhood was full of love, laughter and family’\nLooking back, Madhu Chopra believes that the experience of boarding school had a profound impact on Priyanka’s personality. “She became more confident. She did well in her studies. But emotionally, I think, she was becoming weaker. She couldn’t deal with her emotions very well. That was not such a good thing to happen, but academically she was good, all-round development was very good. So when we brought her home, she was literally taking care of me, her brother. She has become a very responsible young ten-year-old that I knew I would not be able to make because she was such a pampered baby.”\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

        "content": "Mary McGee, a female racing pioneer and subject profiled in an Oscar-contending documentary “Motorcycle Mary,” has died, her family said. She was 87.\n“McGee’s unparalleled achievements in off-road racing and motorcycle racing have inspired generations of athletes that followed in her footsteps,” her family said in a statement.\nThe family said McGee died of complications from a stroke at her home in Gardnerville, Nevada, on Wednesday, the day before the release of the short documentary “Motorcycle Mary” on ESPN’s YouTube channel. Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton was an executive producer on the film, which became available globally on Thursday. Its premiere was at the Tribeca Festival in June.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Mary embodied resilience, grace, and optimism,” McGee’s family wrote on social media. “She was a historic athlete and a motorsports pioneer who embraced life’s challenges, cared deeply for others, and made time to brighten the lives of those around her. While we are deeply saddened by this loss, we are comforted knowing that her light will continue to shine in everyone she touched.”\nMcGee had an accomplished racing resume, first in auto racing and later in motorcycle racing. She became the first person — man or woman — to complete the grueling Baja 500 off-road race in Mexico solo, which she did in 1975.\nThe film about her was directed by Haley Watson. Two-time Oscar winner Ben Proudfoot also was an executive producer.\n“I’m deeply saddened by this news, but I am comforted to know that Mary was surrounded by friends and family at the time of her passing,” Watson said. “In early 2022, I was researching stories when I came across Mary’s. That discovery marked the tipping point into uncovering a much larger and truly incredible career in motorsports and life journey.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nShortly after her family announced her death, Hamilton paid tribute on his Instagram account: “I’m deeply saddened to hear that Mary McGee, the first woman to road race motorcycles in the U.S and the first person to solo the Baja 500 has passed on,” Hamilton wrote. “My condolences to her family and everyone who she’s inspired. Her legacy will live on as a trailblazer in the world of motorsports and beyond.”\nBorn in Juneau, Alaska, during World War II, McGee and her older brother were sent to Iowa to live with their grandparents. Her brother became a race car driver and encouraged his sister to take up the sport, even though it was almost unprecedented for women at that time.\nAlso Read | Huge crash as F1 Las Vegas GP qualifying: Williams’ Franco Colapinto loses three wheels as race delayed\nRacing team owner Vasek Polak persuaded McGee to drive a Porsche Spyder, and she won races. Polak later persuaded her to try motorcycle racing and she also excelled.\nSteve McQueen, the late actor and racing enthusiast, was the one who persuaded McGee to take part in the Baja 500.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMcGee was the first woman to race motocross in the United States, the first to compete in an international motocross competition and the first to receive sponsorships from major brands.\nShe was one of the most influential women in the history of motorsports and known for her mentorship of other women in racing.\nMcGee was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2018."

Then a 23-year-old looking to break into the Australian team, Rowell finished the game with flattering figures of 7 for 27, including the prized scalps of Sachin Tendulkar and Ravi Shastri. Here’s the story of the touring teams playing PM XI’s game and Rowell’s trajectory into serving on the board of Cricket Australia.\nBig Story\nIt’s been nearly a week since four people died of gunshot wounds metres away from the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid after violence broke out in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal. This came after a Sambhal court passed an ex-parte order allowing a survey of the mosque by an advocate commissioner, after taking note of a plea that claimed the mosque was built after demolishing a temple.\n“Peace and harmony must be maintained”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the most recent development, the Supreme Court has directed a trial court in UP — which had allowed a survey of the mosque which Hindus claimed was built by destroying the “Shri Hari Har temple” — to temporarily halt proceedings in the matter. “We don’t want to say anything at this stage. But peace and harmony must prevail… this should not happen. You have to be absolutely, totally neutral and ensure that nothing goes wrong,” CJI Sanjiv Khanna said in oral remarks.\nBack in Sambhal, the district court, where the legal battle over the mosque began, assembled to hear the matter for the first time since it allowed a survey of the 16th century structure. The court granted the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) ten more days to submit its report.\nFollowing the dispute, Ajmer has become the newest strain on the fabric of peaceful coexistence of the two communities. In her column, Shazia Ilmi, the BJP national spokesperson, writes: “Besides listening seriously to Mohan Bhagwat’s advice, the likes of Vishnu Gupta can also learn from Dara Shikoh’s insight that there is no essential difference between Islam and Hinduism.”\nWhile the Jama Masjid was built in 1526 by an official of Babur seems to be beyond doubt. Much else about the mosque is unclear, lost among strands of mythology, history, and legal documents. Here’s the story of the mosque, which is at the centre of a row over a court-mandated survey.\nOnly in Express\nADVERTISEMENT\nEarlier this week, the decades-long property feud among the former Mewar royals played out in complete public view following the ‘coronation’ of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Vishvaraj Singh Mewar. The event brought into focus the lives of Rajasthan’s erstwhile royals, and the sway they hold over the public. The Indian Express traveled to Udaipur as battles and palace intrigues of a bygone era came alive in a fight for royal legacy.\nExpress Opinion\n“… the fractured polity of the region and, indeed, the country, is the monumental hurdle to addressing this recurrent nightmare. Air pollution, then, is a shared challenge of the entire Subcontinent and tackling it offers a unique opportunity to build bridges across the troubled waters between South Asian neighbours.”\nIn our Opinion section today, Vikram Patel delves deeper into the air pollution crisis that grips the larger Indian subcontinent, and the need for a cross-border, cross-state solidarity to address this recurrent nightmare.\nIn Politics Today\nThe Congress will launch a “national movement” seeking “free and fair elections” and target the Election Commission (EC) for its “partisan functioning.” At a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party focused on what they believe constitute “electoral malpractices” at all levels, blaming them for its defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra. “The CWC believes the integrity of the entire electoral process is being severely compromised… Increasing sections of society are becoming frustrated and deeply apprehensive,” the resolution stated.\nMovie Review\nADVERTISEMENT\nWondering what to binge-watch this weekend? We’ve got you covered. Neeraj Pandey’s Netflix heist movie Sikandar ka Muqaddar soars on the strength of plot and performance, with stars servicing the story, just the way it should be. “The two-hour plus duration is dotted with twists and turns you don’t see coming, even as the whodunit-howdunit suspense keeps simmering: there are things I did twig on to, but the surprises kept coming, making things enjoyable,” writes Shubhra Gupta’s in her movie review.\nThat’s all for today. Have a lovely weekend!\nUntil next time,\nAriba\nBusiness As Usual by E P Unny"

        "title": "Expert Talk: Is Narayana Murthy right about IAS, IPS and UPSC?",
        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/upsc-current-affairs/upsc-essentials/expert-talk-is-narayana-murthy-right-about-ias-ips-and-upsc-9697237/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy has proposed an overhaul to the civil services, recommending that Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service officers be recruited from business schools and private sector rather than solely relying on the Union Public Service Commission examinations.\nWhile speaking at an event this month, Murthy said, “It is time for India to move from an administrative mindset to a management mindset. The administration is all about the status quo. On the other hand, management is all about vision and high aspiration. It’s about achieving the plausible impossible.”\nAccording to the Infosys co-founder, the current system of competitive UPSC examinations can only produce civil servants trained in general administration. He recommended a management-based approach that focuses on vision, cost control, innovation, and rapid execution to cater to the changing demands of governance. To what extent is the co-founder right about not solely relying on the Union Public Service Commission examinations for hiring civil servants?\nADVERTISEMENT\nManas Srivastava talks to Ravi Kapoor, our expert, who answers some of the pertinent questions arising from the above mentioned comments of Narayana Murthy.\nAbout our Expert: Ravi Kapoor (Ex-IRS) offers free quality mentorship to UPSC aspirants, drawing upon his ten years of experience to create customised and productive curriculum. Through a free mentorship programme, he integrates tailored educational materials, psychological principles, visual learning techniques, and a strong emphasis on mental well-being into his teaching skills granting aspirants a chance to learn from his expertise.\nQ. What is your take on the recent comment of Narayana Murthy on IAS, IPS, UPSC?\nRavi Kapoor: He has a point, but it’s not entirely accurate. UPSC and LBSNAA are not static institutions — they’ve evolved with the times. Ideas such as digitisation, e-governance, and New Public Management, which draw inspiration from the private sector, are already part of governance today. However, comparing civil services to the private sector overlooks fundamental differences in their nature of work.\nFor example, an SP managing law and order in a district deals with situations like communal tensions, protests, or even natural disasters. Their decisions directly impact lives, public safety, and societal harmony, often in unpredictable, high-stakes scenarios. Contrast this with the CEO of a car manufacturer, whose primary focus is on optimising production, increasing sales, and ensuring profitability. While the CEO can focus on clear metrics like revenue growth, an SP or IAS officer must often work under conflicting pressures, balancing diverse public interests with limited resources.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSimilarly, an IAS officer implementing rural development schemes must navigate political, cultural, and logistical challenges that have no parallel in the corporate world. They don’t have the luxury of unilateral decision-making or the flexibility to pivot quickly without public accountability.\nWhile the push for greater efficiency and innovation in governance is valid, it’s essential to recognise that the public sphere operates under a completely different set of principles—focused on equity, inclusion, and accountability rather than profit. Suggesting that civil servants adopt corporate practices is useful, but the comparison must be made with an understanding of these stark contrasts.\nQ. What do you feel about Narayana Murthy’s comparison between Civil Servants and IIM graduates?\nRavi Kapoor: I respect Narayana Murthy for his immense contributions, but his comparison between IAS officers and corporate professionals misses some critical nuances.\nIAS officers already undergo training at premier institutions like IIMs as part of their induction. Interestingly, many IIM graduates themselves choose to join the civil services, recognizing the broader impact and challenges of governance. Moreover, the government routinely engages consultancy firms like Deloitte, which is populated by IIM alumni, to provide specialised inputs on policy and execution.\nWhen it comes to intellectual and behavioral qualities, IIM graduates hold no inherent advantage over IAS officers. If anything, IAS officers bring a more well-rounded skill set to the table. They possess a higher degree of emotional intelligence, broader exposure to diverse socio-political landscapes, and the ability to work under extreme constraints. Their roles demand dynamism, resilience, and an unmatched ability to balance competing interests — all while operating in a highly scrutinised public sphere.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile efficiency and innovation are vital, it’s incorrect to assume that importing more IIM-trained individuals into the IAS would be a game-changer. The two groups are already part of the same intellectual ecosystem, but IAS officers often face far greater challenges, requiring them to rise to levels of adaptability and leadership that few others experience.\nQ. What is the difference between B-schools and Civil Services as institutions?\nRavi Kapoor: B-schools and the civil services are fundamentally different in purpose, training, and principles. B-schools are designed to prepare individuals for profit-driven environments. For example, at IIMs, students are trained in marketing strategies, consumer behavior, and profit maximisation. They learn to sell products, manage brands, and drive business growth. Success in a B-school is measured by one’s ability to increase shareholder value and optimise efficiencies within a competitive market.\nIn contrast, at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy Of Administration (LBSNAA), civil servants are trained with a completely different focus. The core principle is not to sell, but to serve.\nOfficers are prepared to handle governance, address public grievances, and implement policies that impact millions, often in environments fraught with political, social, and economic complexities. An IAS officer in training learns how to manage disaster relief, oversee public welfare programs, and balance development priorities, all while maintaining equity and accountability.\nFor instance, a corporate CEO might focus on marketing a car to maximize sales, whereas a District Magistrate (DM) might focus on ensuring fair distribution of essential supplies like food or water during a crisis. While both roles require leadership, the DM works in an environment where profits are irrelevant, and the stakes involve human lives and public trust.\nADVERTISEMENT\nQ. What is wrong with Civil Services for which reforms are being suggested?\nRavi Kapoor: The civil services face challenges like rigidity, bureaucratic silos, and a slow pace of decision-making, which often stem from their hierarchical structure. In a democracy, governance prioritizes consensus over speed, which can create delays, but that doesn’t mean the system is beyond reform.\nOne key issue is the lack of specialisation. Officers frequently rotate between departments, making it difficult to build deep expertise in critical sectors like health, technology, or urban planning. Introducing more lateral entry, where professionals from diverse fields join the civil services mid-career, is a reform I strongly support. This would inject fresh perspectives and domain-specific expertise into governance while complementing the generalist skills of IAS officers.\nReforms like performance-linked evaluations, digitisation, and modern training methods have already begun addressing these issues. However, the focus must now shift to encouraging innovation, fostering accountability, and creating an environment where both civil servants and lateral entrants can thrive together.\nQ. How would such a comment impact aspirants and the institution of Civil Services?\nRavi Kapoor: For aspirants, comments like these can be disheartening. But it’s important to see them as an opportunity for introspection. Instead of feeling demoralised, aspirants should focus on preparing for the real-world challenges of governance. As for the institution, such criticism reminds us that visible results matter. Civil servants must ensure their work inspires trust and confidence among the public, which is the ultimate test of their effectiveness.\nADVERTISEMENT\nQ. What would you recommend as a way forward?\nRavi Kapoor: The way forward lies in embracing reforms that make the system more agile, specialised, and outcome-oriented. Lateral entry is a step in the right direction. By bringing in professionals with deep domain expertise from outside the traditional bureaucracy, we can complement the broader skills of IAS officers and create a more dynamic governance ecosystem.\nAdditionally:\nEncourage Specialisation: Allow officers to gain in-depth expertise in sectors like technology, health, and education to handle complex, modern challenges.\nExpand Training: LBSNAA’s curriculum should focus more on real-world problem-solving, case-based learning, and collaborative leadership.\nReward Innovation: Build mechanisms to recognise and reward civil servants who demonstrate exceptional initiative and results.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPromote Collaboration: Foster a culture where lateral entrants, civil servants, and external experts work together seamlessly to create holistic solutions.\nBy combining the experience and adaptability of civil servants with the domain expertise of lateral entrants, we can create a governance model that is both modern and rooted in the values of public service. This balance is key to meeting India’s evolving challenges while ensuring efficiency and equity.\nFor your queries and suggestions write at manas.srivastava@indianexpress.com.\nThe Indian Express UPSC Essentials brings to you the November issue of its monthly magazine.

        "content": "The Eurasian Group (EAG) has identified more than 600 people linked to international networks involved in terror financing this year, its top official said here.\nIdentifying ways of financing international terrorists and their financiers has emerged as the biggest challenge at present and this issue was discussed at length during the 41st plenary meeting of the EAG comprising nine countries, EAG chairman Yuri Chikhanchin said on Friday.\nHe was addressing a press conference after the conclusion of the five-day meet that began on November 25. Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, India, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are the nine member countries of the EAG.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This is the biggest challenge that we are facing – identifying channels of financing, financiers and sustainment of international terrorists because we all are international these days,” Chikhanchin said.\n“This year itself, over 600 people have been identified in our region via the analysis of financial intelligence units (FIU) of countries associated with EAG. We have identified these people on the basis of their financial behaviour. This is a great result, and it will give us more opportunities in the future to enhance this work,” the organisation chairman said.\nThis was a big success, and it will create new opportunities to bolster the campaign to identify people involved in financing terrorism, he said.\nReplying to a query on Afghanistan, he said in the current global scenario, the risks related to terrorism are not limited to any one country.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The risk of terrorism across the region is the most prevalent and most troubling. Afghanistan is one country in which the risk of terrorism is still relevant. We are thinking about joint measures to tackle this risk emanating from Afghanistan,” Chikhanchin said.\nAccording to him, in one of the sessions of the EAG meetings, ways to strengthen the organisation’s relations with Afghanistan and reduce the risk of terrorism in that country were discussed.\n“We have discussed in one of our meetings how to fortify and enhance our relations with Afghanistan and how to minimise the risk and the situation there that it still triggers,” he added.\nAsked about the impact of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and West Asia in the global fight against money laundering and terror financing, Chikhanchin said, “Eurasian Group is a purely technical organisation. We never discuss issues of political nature. We stand against terrorism financing and money laundering.” When asked whether the EAG is considering recommending a ban on cryptocurrencies due to their misuse in money laundering and terror financing, he said the regulation of the existing framework of cryptocurrencies is a serious and complex issue, and the world needs to find a solution together.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVivek Aggarwal, who participated in the EAG meeting as the head of the Indian delegation (HOD), said this five-day meeting was beneficial for the host country in many ways.\nAggarwal, who is the additional secretary of the revenue department of the Finance Ministry and the Director of the country’s FIU, said the 600 people identified by EAG chairman Chikhanchin in connection with terror financing cases also include persons involved in cross-border financial transactions.\nIn these cases, the units through which these transactions were done have also been identified, he added.\nAggarwal said, “The EAG meeting discussed in detail the terrorist financing from across the border in the Indian context. It discussed the role of organisations like Al Qaeda, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashkar-e-Taiba and their affiliates as well as the international transaction of money by them.” The EAG meeting also discussed such cases in which money was transacted through cryptocurrencies, which could be used to strengthen terrorism, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe financial technology (fintech) industry and digital payment system are growing at the fastest pace in India, and cybercrimes and ways to deal with them were also discussed during the meeting, Aggarwal added."

        "content": "Dismissing a plea seeking quashing of an FIR registered against a government servant for allegedly abetting his junior colleague to commit suicide by “insulting” him (including swearing at him and giving him a slap) during working hours on the office premises while “reprimanding” him, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has said that cracking the whip on the staff by superiors at workplace should not be at the cost of “bullying”and “humiliating” them.\nThe high court said, “It is true that administration of the department or an office requires certain hold and control of the employees by superiors but it does not require humiliation and bullying at workplace.”\nA bench of Justice Karamjit Singh was hearing the petition filed by Balwan Singh, who sought to quash the FIR registered against him in 2015 under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of IPC at Kaithal (Haryana).\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs per the case, the FIR was registered on a statement made by Manoj Kumar (brother of deceased) who stated that his elder brother Joginder Singh was working as a Class IV employee in Animal Husbandry Department and was posted at veterinary hospital in Rohera village. According to Manoj Kumar, on October 14, 2015, he received a telephonic message that “his brother Joginder Singh has committed suicide by hanging from a fan in a room of the hospital”. On receiving the message, he went to the Rohera hospital. The checking of the body led to recovery of a “suicide note” on his person (from deceased’s trouser pocket). He read the suicide note wherein it was written that on that day Balwan Singh (accused) – posted as a Veterinary Livestock Development Assistant (VLDA) in government veterinary hospital, Rohera, – had “insulted Joginder Singh” (the deceased) and called him “dishonest” and “uttered bad words” and also “gave a slap on his face”. Joginder Singh “could not bear the insult” and due to this he was compelled to end his life, alleged Manoj Kumar in his complaint. The FIR was thus registered against Balwan Singh.\nAlso Read | Abetment of suicide: why SC cautioned against ‘unnecessary prosecutions’\nBalwan Singh’s counsel contended that Joginder Singh (the deceased) was working under his client (Balwan Singh) and there were allegations that Joginder Singh was charging extra money from the general public to provide treatment to cattle. Also, Joginder Singh used to issue medical prescriptions without having any authority to do so. On this, Balwan Singh (the petitioner) reprimanded him and also advised him (Joginder Singh) not to demand bribe from the villagers who come to the hospital for treatment of their cattle, the counsel contended.\nHowever, the state counsel and the counsel for complainant (Manoj Kumar) submitted that the petitioner not only reprimanded Joginder Singh but also abused and slapped him and used offensive language against him. He could not bear the insult and ended his life by committing suicide, it was submitted, adding that he (Joginder Singh) left behind a suicide note wherein he specifically “blamed the petitioner for his death”. Referring to a Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report, the state counsel also apprised the court that the handwriting and the signature appearing in the suicide note were found to be matching with the standard handwriting and signature of the deceased.\nAlso Read | Is it fun banter or workplace bullying? How to tell the difference (and stop it!)\nOn hearing the matter, the high court said, “It is true that administration of the department or an office requires certain hold and control of the employees by superiors but it does not require humiliation and bullying at workplace. In case, petitioner herein got complaints regarding working or corrupt practices adopted by the deceased, he should have reported the same to his seniors so as to proceed against the deceased in accordance with law. However apparently, no such complaint in writing was received by the petitioner with regard to working of the deceased, prior to the occurrence in question.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn case, the petitioner was unhappy with the working of the deceased, he should have verbally reprimanded the deceased, but there was no occasion or reason for the petitioner to slap the deceased or to use abusive language against him, as is recorded in the suicide note in question, and the deceased took the drastic step as he was unable to bear the said humiliation, said the high court.\nThe court noted that all this happened on the premises of the hospital during working hours on October 14, 2015, and thereafter, Joginder Singh committed suicide on the very same day and left behind a suicide note. “Thus, there was positive action on the part of the petitioner proximate to the time of suicide” which prima facie led him to end his life. While dismissing the petition, the high court also noted that “no material is available on the record that the deceased was frustrated or feeling depressed on account of work pressure or was facing some family problem”."

        "content": "Her movie review: Just as ‘his’stories don’t often delve into resilience and struggles, ‘her’stories too needn’t always centre around overcoming social barriers; they can also be tales of everyday lives that are only occasionally eventful, despite being marked by covert misogyny. While director Lijin Jose’s Her — which finally got released after a two-year delay — partly fits this description, it falters big time, leaving audiences with a somewhat impassive impression.\nLijin Jose is undoubtedly one of the filmmakers who played a key role in ushering in a new wave in Malayalam cinema — marked by unconventional visual and storytelling techniques — with his debut directorial Friday (2012) starring Fahadh Faasil and employing a hyperlink narrative. Her, the director’s first feature film in 10 years, revolves around five women — Santha (Urvashi), Ruchi (Parvathy Thiruvothu), Anamika (Aishwarya Rajesh), Reshma (Ramya Nambessan) and Abhinaya (Lijomol Jose) — hailing from different socio-economic backgrounds. “It is not an anthology, each of these (five) women has their storylines but some of them are interconnected,” Lijin had said during a pre-release interview with OTTplay and true to that, the central thread connecting the five characters is their shared connection to the multifaceted city of Thiruvananthapuram, where the entire film unfolds.\nSikandar Ka Muqaddar movie review | Neeraj Pandey’s Netflix film is a rare beast in Bollywood, a pulpy character study with twists you don’t see coming\nADVERTISEMENT\nInterestingly, Lijin and writer Archana Vasudev ensure that each storyline retains its distinct tone and individuality, without significant overlap, yet the narratives are subtly intertwined through coincidences or certain shared elements. While some of the characters face life-altering challenges, others deal with seemingly minor inconveniences; however, a closer look reveals that even these smaller struggles hold profound significance within the context of each one’s personal life.\nThe film opens with Anamika rushing to attend a crucial PSC interview, after a rough start to her day, which includes a quarrel over the phone with a loved one who disapproves of her pursuing this job. Following an impressive animated title sequence, accompanied by a motivating track composed by Govind Vasantha, the first shot in the film features a line of fire ants, known for causing a burning sensation when they sting. While ironing her saree during the call, Anamika notices an ant crawling onto the fabric, almost intruding on her conversation, much like a swargathile katturumb (a Malayalam adage meaning “black ant in heaven,” referring to unwelcome intrusions). Though she gently removes the ant without harming it, as with many intruders, it soon returns, sticking to her saree unnoticed.\nWatch Her Malayalam movie trailer here:\nOn her way to the interview centre, the ant starts biting her between her thighs, causing immense discomfort. Her attempts to find a restroom for relief are thwarted by the lack of accessible options in male-dominated public spaces. Desperate, she takes an auto-rickshaw for privacy, only to face further harassment from the pervert driver. Anamika’s story poignantly shows the challenges women face in even the simplest of situations, where removing a biting ant from one’s body is a vexing task in a world rife with predatory gazes. On a broader level, it also serves as an analogy for the nosy tendencies of society, where boundaries — both physical and personal — are constantly violated.\nWhile the story of influencer-cum-movie producer Reshma highlights the elitist behaviour of the glitterati, exploiting anyone and everyone for personal gain without a second thought, Santha’s arc also shows the importance of intimacy and communication in romantic relationships, regardless of age. At the same time, Abhinaya’s story explores the critical role of sexual synergy before committing to lifelong partnerships like marriage as well. Ruchi’s tale, on the other hand, is deeply personal, chronicling a chaotic morning in her life that culminates in a severe panic attack and mental breakdown-inducing situation — tragically on an important day at work.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWoman of the Hour movie review | Anna Kendrick’s inventive serial killer thriller takes stabs in the dark\nIn its runtime of just about 97 minutes, Her does offer a glimpse into the lives of five different women but, unfortunately, comes across as insincere and performative. The movie lacks an organic flow, with elements seemingly inserted just for the sake of it rather than purpose. As the movie begins, we see Aishwarya Rajesh breaking the fourth wall. While this can be seen as a testament to the subjects the movie deals with, its needlessness is too glaring. This choice is further undermined by Anamika’s second fourth-wall break at the end when her storyline intersects with Ruchi’s. These moments, instead of adding depth, create an unwarranted distance between the characters and the audience. Even without these shots, the essence of Anamika and Ruchi’s storylines is clear, making these artistic choices feel redundant. Moreover, since not all the stories in the movie engage in direct discourse with the audience, these fourth-wall breaks feel disjointed and poorly executed.\nWhile Lijin succeeds in conveying the tension and discomfort that Anamika experiences, her storyline as a whole lacks cohesion, feeling like a collection of disconnected scenes devoid of any depth. Meanwhile, the depiction of a few token “perverts” in her world serves no meaningful purpose, as these characters and their actions are inadequately written into the story. Aishwarya’s performance fares well in high-tension moments but falls short in others, particularly during the opening phone conversation, which comes across as contrived and unnatural.\nSookshmadarshini movie review | Basil Joseph, Nazriya Nazim deliver a suspenseful and hilarious mystery comedy\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe portrayal of social media celebrity Reshma is another weak point. Although her hyper personality requires exaggeration, Ramya’s performance feels extremely amateurish. Her character and arc feel excessively artificial, as though shaped by superficial observations from social media trends, resulting in an uninspired and lacklustre arc here. Unfortunately, this issue extends to the Abhinaya track too, which suffers from similar shortcomings.\nIn contrast, Santha’s arc stands out as the film’s most compelling one, thanks to Urvashi’s masterful and natural performance. Paired with Pratap Pothen (in a posthumous role) as her husband, the two share a delightful on-screen chemistry. Urvashi’s flawless dialogue delivery, unmatched by the younger actors in the cast, underscores why she is an absolute GOAT. She beautifully portrays Santha’s subtle jealousy towards an Alexa device her husband interacts with more than her, imbuing the character with layers of depth through even the slightest gestures.\nSorgavaasal movie review | Terrific performances keeps this meandering prison thriller within its boundaries\nWhile Parvathy’s story is also compelling, bolstered by her strong and deeply personal performance, Lijin and Archana fail to fully capitalise on its potential. Towards the end, the film reveals Anamika and Ruchi as romantic partners and the insincerity, apparent in other parts of the movie, becomes all the more glaring here. The depiction of their lesbian relationship feels like a token gesture, seemingly added to tick off a checklist of elements typically associated with feminist films.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis performativity also prevents Her from achieving the depth and resonance of other feminist works, such as B 32 Muthal 44 Vare (2023). Instead, it feels like a calculated attempt to capitalise on the popularity of feminist narratives, in/advertently trivialising the very movement it seeks to represent. On the technical front, the film benefits from Govind Vasantha’s evocative music and Sameera Saneesh’s excellent costume design, both of which provide moments of polish in an otherwise uneven effort.\nHer movie cast: Urvashi, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Aishwarya Rajesh, Ramya Nambessan, Lijomol Jose\nHer movie director: Lijin Jose\nHer movie rating: 1.5 stars"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/greg-rowley-australia-pm-xi-tradition-india-sachin-tendulkar-9697751/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "“Sachin Tendulkar wasn’t such a big name then; Ravi Shastri was,” says the one-time Aussie first-class pace bowler Greg Rowell with a laugh. A successful lawyer and Cricket Australia official in his mid-50s now, he is talking about the 1991 Prime Minister’s XI game at Manuka Oval, where the current India team is set to play the warm-up game from Saturday.\nRowell, 23 then, and looking to break into the Australian team, finished the game with flattering figures of 7 for 27, including the wickets of Tendulkar and Shastri. Like now, India had played just one Test before that PM’s X1 game then and the 18-year old Tendulkar hadn’t yet scored much. But soon, hundreds at Perth and Sydney Tests would follow. “Oh, by the end of the series though, I would know who Tendulkar really was,” he says.\nThe Prime Minister’s XI games were a big deal then in Australian cricket, with talented youngsters rubbing shoulders with seniors and having a crack at the national scene. “It was televised nationally, and for us first-class players, it was a game where the country saw and judged you,” Rowell recalls.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn that game, apart from young Rowell, there was Shane Warne, Damien Martin, Matthew Hayden, Michael Bevan, Damien Fleming with his mullet hair style, Greg Blewett, Jamie Siddons and Tim Zoehrer. Rowell grew up in Canberra but played his cricket in Sydney as Canberra cricket wasn’t big then.\nBig challenge ahead for the PM’s XI at Manuka Oval this week against an amazing Indian side. ⁰⁰\nBut as I said to PM @narendramodi, I’m backing the Aussies to get the job done. pic.twitter.com/zEHdnjQDLS\n— Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) November 28, 2024\nThe Rohit Sharma-led Indian team, too, met with Australian PM Anthony Albanese ahead of their pink-ball practice game in the capital against PM’s XI. When the PM told Virat Kohli in jest that his Perth century kept adding to the grief of Baggy Greens, Kohli is reported to have retorted cheekily, “Always gotta add some spice”.\nBut Albanese was only following a long-held tradition.\nThe touring team playing PM’s XI dates back to the time when Australia had the cricket-tragic prime minister, Robert Menzies. That was 1951, when the vastly popular West Indies team was in the country and Menzies spotted a gap in the schedule when the visitors weren’t playing a game. So he called up the Australian cricket board head and said he would like to throw a game at Canberra, Australia’s capital and home of its parliament and politicians.\n“I added that it was a personal proposition, not a government matter; that I would personally guarantee the expenses, including transport of players and if any profit resulted, it would go to the Canberra Legacy Club, devoted to helping widows and children of fallen comrades,” he is supposed to have said.\nThe cricket chairman’s request was not to reveal any “secret weapons” in terms of players and the PM assured him that it would be a few retired players, a couple of members of parliament, three local players. “He agreed, I thought a little reluctantly. But his fears were not as great as mine; for if the match was washed out by rain, or public attendance small, I would be up for a sizable sum of money,” Menzies wrote in his book, “The Measure of Years”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 1963, even Don Bradman played for PM’s XI, years after his retirement. Incidentally, he scored four runs, the exact number he needed in his last international game to get the average of 100; back then, he would, of course, fall for a duck. On getting out in 1963, Bradman reportedly told Menzies, “It wouldn’t happen in a thousand years! Anyway, that’s my final appearance at the wicket.”\nThese games stopped after Menzies’s tenure, but another popular prime minister, Bob Hawke, revived the fixture in 1983. “In that game, David Boon, a young talented opener at the time, hit a hundred against the famous West Indies team, and months later he represented Australia. That fixture gained such a reputation from then in the Australian cricketing fraternity,” recalls Rowell.\nIncidentally, Rowell was part of the crowd that day when Boon sparkled. “I was just a kid and went with my brother. I remember the ground was packed. West Indies were a big box-office those days in Australia; Viv Richards, Joel Garner, Michael Holding, probably Andy Roberts — every big name played that game, and the Canberra crowd, who don’t get to see much big cricket, was thrilled,” he says. Even Dennis Lillee, who had just retired from international cricket a few weeks ago, and Jeff Thomson played that game.\nRowell soon returns to the 1991 game. “I remember Shastri spoke warmly at the end of the game. And Prime Minister Hawke, back from those days when politicians were popular, came to the dressing room to have a chat. That was a thrill.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSelection letter that Greg Rowell received to play for the PM’s XI)\nA few years later, Rowell found himself playing for Australia A against the main Australian team in the world series game, needing to restrict Steve Waugh and Ian Healy from getting just three runs in the last over. He nearly did, yorking Waugh to dot balls.\n“I decided to go for a yorker again and I probably shouldn’t have bowled that to Healy. A rapid fast ball might have done the trick. And I also remember a fully packed crowd’s screams as I approached the crease- and that threw me off a bit. It ended as a full toss, and Healy’s shot sliced off the outer edge over backward point.” Video footage reveals Rowell, walking off grim.\nRowell, who couldn’t make it to the Australian team, pursued his education, became a lawyer, has a law firm, and is now on the board of Cricket Australia. “I also toured India a few times as a lawyer-cricketer; the world might not know but we do have a lawyers’ World Cup,” he says.\nPosh Lawyer, cricket board member, fast bowler, and the man who took out Tendulkar. “The Prime Minister’s XI doesn’t quite have that kind of standing in Australian cricket. It was a different world then,” he says."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-pakistan-disagree-champions-trophy-icc-meeting-9697604/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "With the cricket boards of India and Pakistan sticking to their stand at the ICC convened video call on Friday, a cloud of certainty hung over next year’s Champions Trophy scheduled to be held in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. PCB insisted they can’t agree to India’s demand of a ‘hybrid model’ and BCCI remained adamant about not travelling to Pakistan — both saying they were following their respective government’s advice.\nAs for the ICC, they asked for time. Those in the know say that the meeting lasted for barely 15 minutes because of the stalemate. An ICC official in the know would say: “The Board did meet briefly today. All parties continue to work towards a positive resolution for the Champions Trophy 2025 and it is expected that the Board will reconvene in the next few days.”\nSources in the PCB would say, “ICC was trying to find out a plausible solution” and “some formulas are expected to come up tomorrow.” However, a BCCI official stated that “India playing in Pakistan can’t be and wouldn’t be a formula that ICC will float”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSo with the ball in their court, what will the ICC do? With the BCCI secretary Jay Shah all set to take over as the ICC chairman in a couple of days, several neutrals say, like always, the world’s richest board, the BCCI, will have its way.\nAn old Indian board hand said: “Before the Asia Cup last year, the situation was similar but finally Pakistan agreed to move India games outside Pakistan. This time, in case they insist on India traveling to Pakistan, the Champions Trophy will be moved out,” he said. “And in case they boycott the event that is played elsewhere, the tournament will go ahead without Pakistan.”\nPakistan in their argument has quoted a October, 2024 letter circulated by the ICC board among its members. It talks about the finalising of the schedule that was approved by the broadcaster. The communication mentions how no country has raised objection to the itinerary.\nWithin a fortnight of that letter, the BCCI informed the ICC about their reservations over traveling to Pakistan. “Situations between two countries change within days. All we are doing is just going by what the Indian government wants,” said a BCCI official.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAny decision taken with regards to the Champions Trophy will have a bearing on future ICC events to be hosted by India and Pakistan. If India doesn’t travel to Pakistan for the event, it remains to be seen if the Pakistan women’s team crosses the border for next year’s 50-over World Cup. Thereafter, BCCI is also scheduled to host three men’s ICC events from 2025-2031.\nA day before the ICC meet on Friday, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi had said that he had raised the issue of equality with the ICC. “We’re still clear in our stance that it’s not acceptable that we play cricket in India, and they don’t play cricket here. Whatever will happen, will happen on the basis of equality. We’ve told the ICC very clearly, and what happens next we’ll let you know.”\n.For the ICC, it is a tricky situation to solve as it cannot go ahead with an event without India, on whom it is heavily dependent on revenue Playing the Champions Trophy in a neutral venue while PCB retains the hosting rights remains a strong possibility, but ICC needs to convince Pakistan on that front.\nIt is understood that the ICC hasn’t sounded out any other member as yet, but it is expected to take stock of alternate options with the UAE and South Africa being the favoured destinations as of now, especially because the timing would suit the broadcasters.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf it is UAE, weather won’t be a cause of concern as the temperature is usually known to be pleasant in February-March. South Africa too remains a likely destination."

        "title": "‘Anti-national’, ‘pro-Myanmar': Manipur govt attacks BJP’s Mizo ally for criticism of Biren Singh",
        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/anti-national-pro-myanmar-manipur-govt-attacks-bjp-mizo-criticism-biren-singh-9697739/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "Training its guns on the Mizo National Front (MNF) for seeking Chief Minister Biren Singh’s resignation, the Manipur government has dubbed the Mizoram ally of the BJP an “anti-national party”. It also alleged that Mizoram is “currently… the primary route” for the transit of arms, ammunition and drugs between India and Myanmar.\nThe MNF – which, despite its differences with the BJP on multiple matters, is still a member of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) – is the main Opposition party in Mizoram after the Zoram People’s Movement formed the government in the state last year.\nWhen the Manipur conflict began in May 2023, the MNF was the ruling party, with Zoramthanga as Chief Minister. The Mizos share a deep ethnic bond with the Kukis of Manipur, and the Mizoram government since the MNF time has been vocal in its support to them in their conflict with the Meiteis.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a long official press statement issued on Thursday night – the day the MNF sought Biren Singh’s removal – the Manipur government accused the MNF of “constant meddling” in Manipur’s internal affairs and said it had employed “a shrill wave of anti-national pro-Myanmar refugee propaganda and anti-Manipur stance” in the Assembly elections in Mizoram last year.\n“To refresh public memory, this political party has been consistently revealing its true colours as an anti-national party with its strong opposition to the efforts of the Indian Government to fence its open borders with neighbouring Myanmar for the purpose of curbing illegal immigration, trafficking of arms and drugs, internal security and defence. Myanmar is the origin of most of the illegal immigration and drugs problems that Manipur has been facing… The ongoing crisis in Manipur is a creation of illegal immigrants from Myanmar, whose economy, after illegally settling in the State, driven by cultivation of illicit poppy, had taken a severe hit under Chief Minister N. Biren Singh’s War on Drugs,” reads the Manipur government’s statement.\nThe Manipur government also alleged an agenda to create a “Kuki-Chin nation” as a factor in the ongoing conflict in the state. “We must be wary of the greater agenda of carving a Kuki-Chin nation out of (the) contiguous areas of Myanmar, India and Bangladesh, played out over decades of meticulous planning, through illegal immigration, land grabbing, displacement of original indigenous peoples, formation of Kuki-Chin dominated districts, establishment of Autonomous District Councils, upgradation of such Councils to Scheduled Areas, amalgamation of Kuki-Chin areas and finally Nationhood. The Government of Manipur will not allow fragmentation of North East India at the behest of foreign vested interests either in Manipur or in its neighbourhood. Any individual, group or organization working with such intent shall be met with the strong hands of the law,” reads the statement.\nThe Manipur government’s response invoking the Myanmar angle enters sensitive territory as Mizoram has thrown open its doors to refugees from the country as they share the same larger Kuki-Zo ethnic identity as people on this side of the border. In this too, the MNF’s stand is no different from the ruling ZPM’s.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Centre’s resolve to fence the porous Indo-Myanmar border has hence been opposed by both the MNF and the ZPM government, as well as by the Nagaland government, led by another member of the NEDA, Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party.\nEarlier, CM Biren Singh had reacted sharply to speeches made during a US trip in September by Lalduhoma speaking about Zo unity and “the aspiration of integration of the Zo people” across territories. “No one can touch Manipur’s integrity,” Biren Singh had said.\nIn its statement, the MNF sought Biren Singh’s removal saying that “suffering inflicted on Zofate brethren (referring to the Kuki-Zomi community)… has reached intolerable levels”. Biren Singh’s “inaction and misuse of power have only worsened the situation, making his continuation in office both untenable and shameful”, the MNF said.\nBefore that, MNF Rajya Sabha MP K Vanlalvena sought Biren Singh’s removal as well as President’s Rule in Manipur.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBesides, Mizoram CM Lalduhoma stated in an interview recently to The Hindustan Times that President’s Rule was preferable to the current state government in Manipur.\nThe Manipur government statement on Thursday, however, only referred to the MNF’s remarks.\nIn the statement, the Manipur government also claimed that the Biren Singh government’s ‘War on Drugs’ had led to a drop in drug trafficking in Manipur, adding: “Mizoram has now emerged as the favoured route for international transit of illegal arms, ammunition and drugs between India and Myanmar.”\nThe statement added: “The MNF should focus on the looming threat on Mizo society from the drugs trade instead of passing unwarranted comments on legally justified acts of the Government of Manipur to combat drugs trafficking. If requested by the MNF, the Government of Manipur will extend all assistance to the efforts of the State of Mizoram towards curbing drugs.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Mizoram government has not responded so far to the Manipur government’s charges, including to queries sent by The Indian Express."

        "content": "A 21-year-old man from Kannur in Kerala who was on the run since November 26 allegedly after killing a 19-year-old woman from Assam at a Bengaluru hotel was arrested on Friday from near the airport in Devanahalli.\nThe trail of Aarav Hanoy took the police to Uttar Pradesh as he had boarded a train to Varanasi, the police probe revealed.\n“The police arrested him on his return to Bengaluru near Devanahalli,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) D Devaraj said on Friday evening.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPolice said initial investigations since the arrest revealed that Hanoy met Maya Gogoi Deka,19,  the victim, on dating app Bumble around six months ago when he first moved to Bengaluru from Kannur. The duo used to talk often and met a couple of times.\n“He had returned to his hometown after not finding a job initially. He came back after the girl helped him obtain an internship in a firm where she had worked earlier. After his return 15 days ago, he proposed a live-in relationship which was rejected by the girl. The murder was a result of an altercation while they were in the hotel room. He procured the knife for the murder after they had checked into the hotel,” police sources said.\nHanoy had not completed his graduation and still had five papers to clear in his BBA course when he moved to Bengaluru. He underwent a HR course and was being paid Rs 15,000 a month for the internship with a job portal, police said.\n“He was referred to the company by Maya Gogoi who previously worked at the firm,” police sources said. She was working with an education consultancy firm as a counsellor after leaving the firm where Aarav had joined, police said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Some kind of jealousy and doubts about the girl is what seems to have triggered the dispute. She was a sociable person while he was an introvert with few friends and not much of family bonding. He has to be questioned extensively,” police sources said.  After they had a fight in the hotel room where they checked in on November 23 at around 12.30 pm, Hanoy is reported to have gone out and obtained a knife and ordered a rope online. The youth had planned to take his own life after the murder but did not do it, police said.\nHanoy allegedly committed the murder on November 24 and remained in the room with the body for two days till the morning of November 26 when he took a cab to the railway station.\n“He boarded the first long distance train he could get and travelled to Varanasi,” police sources said, adding that he was tracked through technical analysis.\nGogoi’s body was found by the hotel staff. “Her phone was inactive since November 24 which suggests that she must have been killed a day after they checked in,” police sources said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to hotel staff, Hanoy and Gogoi booked the room on November 23 for a day. The next day when the manager of the hotel asked about the checkout plans, Hanoy told him that the checkout would happen in the afternoon and later this was changed to the evening and finally to November 25, eventually extended until November 26, according to the FIR registered on a complaint by hotel owner P Ali Imani.\nOn November 26, Hanoy left the hotel abruptly in the morning at 8.28 am and did not respond to phone calls by the staff. When calls to Gogoi also did not yield responses the staff went to the room, they found the body."

        "content": "Her movie review: Just as ‘his’stories don’t often delve into resilience and struggles, ‘her’stories too needn’t always centre around overcoming social barriers; they can also be tales of everyday lives that are only occasionally eventful, despite being marked by covert misogyny. While director Lijin Jose’s Her — which finally got released after a two-year delay — partly fits this description, it falters big time, leaving audiences with a somewhat impassive impression.\nLijin Jose is undoubtedly one of the filmmakers who played a key role in ushering in a new wave in Malayalam cinema — marked by unconventional visual and storytelling techniques — with his debut directorial Friday (2012) starring Fahadh Faasil and employing a hyperlink narrative. Her, the director’s first feature film in 10 years, revolves around five women — Santha (Urvashi), Ruchi (Parvathy Thiruvothu), Anamika (Aishwarya Rajesh), Reshma (Ramya Nambessan) and Abhinaya (Lijomol Jose) — hailing from different socio-economic backgrounds. “It is not an anthology, each of these (five) women has their storylines but some of them are interconnected,” Lijin had said during a pre-release interview with OTTplay and true to that, the central thread connecting the five characters is their shared connection to the multifaceted city of Thiruvananthapuram, where the entire film unfolds.\nSikandar Ka Muqaddar movie review | Neeraj Pandey’s Netflix film is a rare beast in Bollywood, a pulpy character study with twists you don’t see coming\nADVERTISEMENT\nInterestingly, Lijin and writer Archana Vasudev ensure that each storyline retains its distinct tone and individuality, without significant overlap, yet the narratives are subtly intertwined through coincidences or certain shared elements. While some of the characters face life-altering challenges, others deal with seemingly minor inconveniences; however, a closer look reveals that even these smaller struggles hold profound significance within the context of each one’s personal life.\nThe film opens with Anamika rushing to attend a crucial PSC interview, after a rough start to her day, which includes a quarrel over the phone with a loved one who disapproves of her pursuing this job. Following an impressive animated title sequence, accompanied by a motivating track composed by Govind Vasantha, the first shot in the film features a line of fire ants, known for causing a burning sensation when they sting. While ironing her saree during the call, Anamika notices an ant crawling onto the fabric, almost intruding on her conversation, much like a swargathile katturumb (a Malayalam adage meaning “black ant in heaven,” referring to unwelcome intrusions). Though she gently removes the ant without harming it, as with many intruders, it soon returns, sticking to her saree unnoticed.\nWatch Her Malayalam movie trailer here:\nOn her way to the interview centre, the ant starts biting her between her thighs, causing immense discomfort. Her attempts to find a restroom for relief are thwarted by the lack of accessible options in male-dominated public spaces. Desperate, she takes an auto-rickshaw for privacy, only to face further harassment from the pervert driver. Anamika’s story poignantly shows the challenges women face in even the simplest of situations, where removing a biting ant from one’s body is a vexing task in a world rife with predatory gazes. On a broader level, it also serves as an analogy for the nosy tendencies of society, where boundaries — both physical and personal — are constantly violated.\nWhile the story of influencer-cum-movie producer Reshma highlights the elitist behaviour of the glitterati, exploiting anyone and everyone for personal gain without a second thought, Santha’s arc also shows the importance of intimacy and communication in romantic relationships, regardless of age. At the same time, Abhinaya’s story explores the critical role of sexual synergy before committing to lifelong partnerships like marriage as well. Ruchi’s tale, on the other hand, is deeply personal, chronicling a chaotic morning in her life that culminates in a severe panic attack and mental breakdown-inducing situation — tragically on an important day at work.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWoman of the Hour movie review | Anna Kendrick’s inventive serial killer thriller takes stabs in the dark\nIn its runtime of just about 97 minutes, Her does offer a glimpse into the lives of five different women but, unfortunately, comes across as insincere and performative. The movie lacks an organic flow, with elements seemingly inserted just for the sake of it rather than purpose. As the movie begins, we see Aishwarya Rajesh breaking the fourth wall. While this can be seen as a testament to the subjects the movie deals with, its needlessness is too glaring. This choice is further undermined by Anamika’s second fourth-wall break at the end when her storyline intersects with Ruchi’s. These moments, instead of adding depth, create an unwarranted distance between the characters and the audience. Even without these shots, the essence of Anamika and Ruchi’s storylines is clear, making these artistic choices feel redundant. Moreover, since not all the stories in the movie engage in direct discourse with the audience, these fourth-wall breaks feel disjointed and poorly executed.\nWhile Lijin succeeds in conveying the tension and discomfort that Anamika experiences, her storyline as a whole lacks cohesion, feeling like a collection of disconnected scenes devoid of any depth. Meanwhile, the depiction of a few token “perverts” in her world serves no meaningful purpose, as these characters and their actions are inadequately written into the story. Aishwarya’s performance fares well in high-tension moments but falls short in others, particularly during the opening phone conversation, which comes across as contrived and unnatural.\nSookshmadarshini movie review | Basil Joseph, Nazriya Nazim deliver a suspenseful and hilarious mystery comedy\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe portrayal of social media celebrity Reshma is another weak point. Although her hyper personality requires exaggeration, Ramya’s performance feels extremely amateurish. Her character and arc feel excessively artificial, as though shaped by superficial observations from social media trends, resulting in an uninspired and lacklustre arc here. Unfortunately, this issue extends to the Abhinaya track too, which suffers from similar shortcomings.\nIn contrast, Santha’s arc stands out as the film’s most compelling one, thanks to Urvashi’s masterful and natural performance. Paired with Pratap Pothen (in a posthumous role) as her husband, the two share a delightful on-screen chemistry. Urvashi’s flawless dialogue delivery, unmatched by the younger actors in the cast, underscores why she is an absolute GOAT. She beautifully portrays Santha’s subtle jealousy towards an Alexa device her husband interacts with more than her, imbuing the character with layers of depth through even the slightest gestures.\nSorgavaasal movie review | Terrific performances keeps this meandering prison thriller within its boundaries\nWhile Parvathy’s story is also compelling, bolstered by her strong and deeply personal performance, Lijin and Archana fail to fully capitalise on its potential. Towards the end, the film reveals Anamika and Ruchi as romantic partners and the insincerity, apparent in other parts of the movie, becomes all the more glaring here. The depiction of their lesbian relationship feels like a token gesture, seemingly added to tick off a checklist of elements typically associated with feminist films.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis performativity also prevents Her from achieving the depth and resonance of other feminist works, such as B 32 Muthal 44 Vare (2023). Instead, it feels like a calculated attempt to capitalise on the popularity of feminist narratives, in/advertently trivialising the very movement it seeks to represent. On the technical front, the film benefits from Govind Vasantha’s evocative music and Sameera Saneesh’s excellent costume design, both of which provide moments of polish in an otherwise uneven effort.\nHer movie cast: Urvashi, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Aishwarya Rajesh, Ramya Nambessan, Lijomol Jose\nHer movie director: Lijin Jose\nHer movie rating: 1.5 stars"

        "content": "Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy has proposed an overhaul to the civil services, recommending that Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service officers be recruited from business schools and private sector rather than solely relying on the Union Public Service Commission examinations.\nWhile speaking at an event this month, Murthy said, “It is time for India to move from an administrative mindset to a management mindset. The administration is all about the status quo. On the other hand, management is all about vision and high aspiration. It’s about achieving the plausible impossible.”\nAccording to the Infosys co-founder, the current system of competitive UPSC examinations can only produce civil servants trained in general administration. He recommended a management-based approach that focuses on vision, cost control, innovation, and rapid execution to cater to the changing demands of governance. To what extent is the co-founder right about not solely relying on the Union Public Service Commission examinations for hiring civil servants?\nADVERTISEMENT\nManas Srivastava talks to Ravi Kapoor, our expert, who answers some of the pertinent questions arising from the above mentioned comments of Narayana Murthy.\nAbout our Expert: Ravi Kapoor (Ex-IRS) offers free quality mentorship to UPSC aspirants, drawing upon his ten years of experience to create customised and productive curriculum. Through a free mentorship programme, he integrates tailored educational materials, psychological principles, visual learning techniques, and a strong emphasis on mental well-being into his teaching skills granting aspirants a chance to learn from his expertise.\nQ. What is your take on the recent comment of Narayana Murthy on IAS, IPS, UPSC?\nRavi Kapoor: He has a point, but it’s not entirely accurate. UPSC and LBSNAA are not static institutions — they’ve evolved with the times. Ideas such as digitisation, e-governance, and New Public Management, which draw inspiration from the private sector, are already part of governance today. However, comparing civil services to the private sector overlooks fundamental differences in their nature of work.\nFor example, an SP managing law and order in a district deals with situations like communal tensions, protests, or even natural disasters. Their decisions directly impact lives, public safety, and societal harmony, often in unpredictable, high-stakes scenarios. Contrast this with the CEO of a car manufacturer, whose primary focus is on optimising production, increasing sales, and ensuring profitability. While the CEO can focus on clear metrics like revenue growth, an SP or IAS officer must often work under conflicting pressures, balancing diverse public interests with limited resources.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSimilarly, an IAS officer implementing rural development schemes must navigate political, cultural, and logistical challenges that have no parallel in the corporate world. They don’t have the luxury of unilateral decision-making or the flexibility to pivot quickly without public accountability.\nWhile the push for greater efficiency and innovation in governance is valid, it’s essential to recognise that the public sphere operates under a completely different set of principles—focused on equity, inclusion, and accountability rather than profit. Suggesting that civil servants adopt corporate practices is useful, but the comparison must be made with an understanding of these stark contrasts.\nQ. What do you feel about Narayana Murthy’s comparison between Civil Servants and IIM graduates?\nRavi Kapoor: I respect Narayana Murthy for his immense contributions, but his comparison between IAS officers and corporate professionals misses some critical nuances.\nIAS officers already undergo training at premier institutions like IIMs as part of their induction. Interestingly, many IIM graduates themselves choose to join the civil services, recognizing the broader impact and challenges of governance. Moreover, the government routinely engages consultancy firms like Deloitte, which is populated by IIM alumni, to provide specialised inputs on policy and execution.\nWhen it comes to intellectual and behavioral qualities, IIM graduates hold no inherent advantage over IAS officers. If anything, IAS officers bring a more well-rounded skill set to the table. They possess a higher degree of emotional intelligence, broader exposure to diverse socio-political landscapes, and the ability to work under extreme constraints. Their roles demand dynamism, resilience, and an unmatched ability to balance competing interests — all while operating in a highly scrutinised public sphere.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile efficiency and innovation are vital, it’s incorrect to assume that importing more IIM-trained individuals into the IAS would be a game-changer. The two groups are already part of the same intellectual ecosystem, but IAS officers often face far greater challenges, requiring them to rise to levels of adaptability and leadership that few others experience.\nQ. What is the difference between B-schools and Civil Services as institutions?\nRavi Kapoor: B-schools and the civil services are fundamentally different in purpose, training, and principles. B-schools are designed to prepare individuals for profit-driven environments. For example, at IIMs, students are trained in marketing strategies, consumer behavior, and profit maximisation. They learn to sell products, manage brands, and drive business growth. Success in a B-school is measured by one’s ability to increase shareholder value and optimise efficiencies within a competitive market.\nIn contrast, at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy Of Administration (LBSNAA), civil servants are trained with a completely different focus. The core principle is not to sell, but to serve.\nOfficers are prepared to handle governance, address public grievances, and implement policies that impact millions, often in environments fraught with political, social, and economic complexities. An IAS officer in training learns how to manage disaster relief, oversee public welfare programs, and balance development priorities, all while maintaining equity and accountability.\nFor instance, a corporate CEO might focus on marketing a car to maximize sales, whereas a District Magistrate (DM) might focus on ensuring fair distribution of essential supplies like food or water during a crisis. While both roles require leadership, the DM works in an environment where profits are irrelevant, and the stakes involve human lives and public trust.\nADVERTISEMENT\nQ. What is wrong with Civil Services for which reforms are being suggested?\nRavi Kapoor: The civil services face challenges like rigidity, bureaucratic silos, and a slow pace of decision-making, which often stem from their hierarchical structure. In a democracy, governance prioritizes consensus over speed, which can create delays, but that doesn’t mean the system is beyond reform.\nOne key issue is the lack of specialisation. Officers frequently rotate between departments, making it difficult to build deep expertise in critical sectors like health, technology, or urban planning. Introducing more lateral entry, where professionals from diverse fields join the civil services mid-career, is a reform I strongly support. This would inject fresh perspectives and domain-specific expertise into governance while complementing the generalist skills of IAS officers.\nReforms like performance-linked evaluations, digitisation, and modern training methods have already begun addressing these issues. However, the focus must now shift to encouraging innovation, fostering accountability, and creating an environment where both civil servants and lateral entrants can thrive together.\nQ. How would such a comment impact aspirants and the institution of Civil Services?\nRavi Kapoor: For aspirants, comments like these can be disheartening. But it’s important to see them as an opportunity for introspection. Instead of feeling demoralised, aspirants should focus on preparing for the real-world challenges of governance. As for the institution, such criticism reminds us that visible results matter. Civil servants must ensure their work inspires trust and confidence among the public, which is the ultimate test of their effectiveness.\nADVERTISEMENT\nQ. What would you recommend as a way forward?\nRavi Kapoor: The way forward lies in embracing reforms that make the system more agile, specialised, and outcome-oriented. Lateral entry is a step in the right direction. By bringing in professionals with deep domain expertise from outside the traditional bureaucracy, we can complement the broader skills of IAS officers and create a more dynamic governance ecosystem.\nAdditionally:\nEncourage Specialisation: Allow officers to gain in-depth expertise in sectors like technology, health, and education to handle complex, modern challenges.\nExpand Training: LBSNAA’s curriculum should focus more on real-world problem-solving, case-based learning, and collaborative leadership.\nReward Innovation: Build mechanisms to recognise and reward civil servants who demonstrate exceptional initiative and results.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPromote Collaboration: Foster a culture where lateral entrants, civil servants, and external experts work together seamlessly to create holistic solutions.\nBy combining the experience and adaptability of civil servants with the domain expertise of lateral entrants, we can create a governance model that is both modern and rooted in the values of public service. This balance is key to meeting India’s evolving challenges while ensuring efficiency and equity.\nFor your queries and suggestions write at manas.srivastava@indianexpress.com.\nThe Indian Express UPSC Essentials brings to you the November issue of its monthly magazine.

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/why-congress-cwc-resolution-is-silent-on-evms-focus-is-on-the-entire-electoral-process-9697935/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "At a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) held against the backdrop of back-to-back electoral defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, the Opposition party on Friday decided to launch a “national movement” seeking “free and fair elections” and targeted the Election Commission (EC) for its “partisan functioning”. The party decided not to focus solely on the integrity of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) or the demand for a return to ballot papers, and instead agreed to widen the ambit of its movement to the “entire electoral process”.\nDays after Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge called for a return to ballot papers, the larger consensus at the meeting, which lasted four and a half hours, was to focus on what the party believes are “electoral malpractices” at all levels. A section of the Congress leadership thinks it is not prudent to blame EVMs for the losses since the party does not yet have any solid evidence to back its allegations and hence the focus should be broader.\nConsequently, the resolution adopted at the end of the meeting did not mention EVMs. “The CWC believes the integrity of the entire electoral process is being severely compromised. Free and fair elections is a Constitutional mandate that is being called into serious question by the partisan functioning of the Election Commission. Increasing sections of society are becoming frustrated and deeply apprehensive. The Congress will take up these public concerns as a national movement,” read the resolution.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRead more | Disquiet in Congress over EVM blame, internal survey showed party was losing Lok Sabha gains in Maharashtra\nThe CWC blamed “electoral malpractices” for the defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra. “The party’s performance in Haryana has been contrary to all expectations. Very simply, the INC should have formed the government in the state by a convincing margin but it didn’t. But there have been electoral malpractices that have influenced the result in the state which have been overlooked. The CWC also accepts that the party’s performance, as indeed that of its MVA allies, in Maharashtra has been inexplicable and is, in fact, shocking. The electoral outcome is beyond normal understanding. It appears to be a clear case of targeted manipulation,” read the resolution.\nSources said among the leaders who argued strongly that the party should demand a return to ballot papers was AICC general secretary and newly elected Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. At its 2018 session, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) passed a resolution saying to “ensure the credibility of the electoral process, the Election Commission should revert to the old practice of paper ballot as major democracies have done”.\nSpeaking first, Rajya Sabha MP Abhishek Singhvi is learnt to have said that the party should take a consistent stand and the first demand should be a return to ballot papers. He argued that since the government and the EC might not agree with that demand, the party should ask for 100% verification of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips to ensure that votes have been recorded correctly. Senior party leader Digvijaya Singh, who spoke next, concurred. AICC treasurer Ajay Maken argued that, as a start, the party should demand that 10 to 20% of the VVPAT slips be given to the voters for verification.\nCongress’s Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi, argued that the party should not be fixated on EVMs, which are a part of the larger electoral process. He alleged that “electoral malpractice” ranges from the EC’s “partisan behaviour” to tampering of electoral rolls and voter suppression. Sources said Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, agreed with Gogoi’s suggestion, arguing that EVMs should be part of the larger demand for free and fair elections. He told the CWC that the party should take a clear stand and said he never hesitates to take a position, be it on caste census, the Adani issue, or the Constitution and the idea of India.\nADVERTISEMENT\nExpress View | Congress and EVM controversy: Ghost in the machine\nPriyanka asked the party leaders who gave the suggestions to practise them first. She was said to be clear that a return of the ballot paper was the only option to ensure free and fair polls. Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor’s was perhaps the only contrarian view on the issue of EVMs. Gandhi, sources said, told him that the EVM issue had a lot of resonance among people.\nPanel to examine Maharashtra debacle\nLike it did in Haryana, the party has decided to set up an “internal committee” to look into its electoral performance in Maharashtra.\nAsked why the resolution makes no mention of EVMs, the AICC general secretary in charge of organisation, K C Venugopal, told reporters, “We clearly emphasised that electoral malpractices happened during these elections. We have already sent a technical team to Haryana and are going to send a team to Maharashtra also. We will have a detailed analysis at the booth level. There are so many complaints … about the voters’ list and a discrepancy in polling numbers. We will do a thorough analysis. There will be two levels of analysis, one political and another technical.”\nAICC media department chairman Pawan Khera said, “The issue is not just about EVMs. It is about the entire electoral process. We have been complaining about the illegal addition and deletion of names in the voters’ list. But there was no response from the EC. We had flagged the issue of batteries after the Haryana elections, again no response. So, it is not just about the EVMs, it is about the entire electoral process. How it is being compromised is a cause of concern.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile several leaders spoke about the Assembly election debacles, three leaders from Haryana — Randeep Singh Surjewala, Kumari Selja, and Deepender Hooda — did not speak at the meeting. In an apparent reference to Haryana, Chhattisgarh leader Tamradhwaj Sahu argued that the party should ensure that one person is not given the entire charge of the party’s campaign and candidate selection. In the end, Kharge said that while the AICC was being blamed for everything, it was the Pradesh Congress Committees that took all the decisions. He said the AICC “cannot appoint even a peon” without the approval of the state units.\nThe CWC resolution also criticised the government for its “stubborn refusal” to allow discussions in Parliament on the Adani bribery controversy, the continued violence in Manipur, and the “systematic attempts of the BJP to foment communal tensions in different states, most recently in UP”, leading to a washout of the first week of the Winter Session."

        "content": "In a departure from the norm, Canadian education consultants in Punjab are advising aspiring international students to secure offer letters from Canadian colleges and universities but delay their study visa applications for a while. The unusual guidance comes amid ongoing changes to the Canada visa application process, which have left students and consultants waiting for clarity from the embassy.\n“Obtaining an offer letter reserves a seat in the college or university of your choice. However, I strongly advise against submitting a study permit application at this moment,” Tirath Singh, a senior consultant with Jalandhar-based Pinnacle Education, which specialises in Canadian study programmes, said.\nCanada has recently announced several changes to its international student program, including discontinuing the Student Direct Stream (SDS) pathway for students.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTirath explained that the new changes are yet to be reflected on the Canadian embassy’s portal but consultants are continuing to process applications under various categories. Tirath explained that whenever there is any update in visa rules, it is usually accompanied by a lot of confusion. “Until the embassy provides written clarity on the new rules, it is better to wait,” he said.\nExpress Explained | With Canada’s SDS program ending, the path for Indian students to secure visas\n“Rushing to apply without this clarity could lead to unnecessary complications as the same happened last year in August when there was an update regarding the IELTS score. Earlier it was perceived that 6.5 bands were required but when the embassy updated it on the portal, there was proper clarity that overall six bands were required in the four volumes,” he explained.\nIn this period of uncertainty, students should secure offer letters “immediately”, Tirath said, because with increasing competition for admissions, obtaining an offer letter now ensures a reserved spot in the programme.\n“Only minimal payments requested by the colleges should be made to reserve the seat. Students should hold off on additional payments for the chosen courses and visa applications. Students should carefully choose from the list of 970 courses recently released by various institutions, prioritising programmes that offer better job prospects post-graduation,” said Tirath, adding that he recommended that students use the waiting period to strengthen their financial documentation. He also highlighted the option of deferring applications to the 2025 intake, giving students additional time to improve their financial and academic profiles.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Proof of four months’ required funds in the account will be crucial for visa approval and having funds in the account for longer than the stipulated time could be advantageous,” consultant Gurpreet Singh, who is based in Kapurthala, said.\nThe consultants suggested that updates are likely to appear on the embassy portal in one or two weeks. If there are no updates in the coming weeks, students should consult experienced consultants for advice, they added.\n“The advice to delay visa applications comes as some consultants push students to apply immediately,” Gurpreet said, urging students to rely on genuine consultants who prioritise long-term success over short-term gains."

        "content": "Relentless rain forced an early abandonment of the opening day’s play of the two-day pink-ball game between the Indians and the Prime Minister’s XI at Manuka Oval in Canberra. India had a photo-op with the Australian PM, Anthony Albanese, gave him a floppy sun-hat with their autographs, and soon left the arena. The setting – the game and the capital city – though allows us to dwell on the importance of cricket to Australians.\nCanberra is a city of compromise. A city that was birthed, constructed, designed as a balm to developing wounds in the Australian political society. More than hundred years ago, in 1913, due to political rivalries between New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria, the fight was one to where to have the capital and to locate the parliament house.\nOnce it was deemed that the capital had to be at least 100 miles (160 kms) away from Sydney, the Canberra region, inhabited by the Ngunnawal people for thousands of years, was finally chosen. A worldwide designing contest too was undertaken, and the American architect couple Marion Mahony Griffin and her husband Walter Burley won, and dreamed up the capital in their imagination.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Manuka Oval celebrated its 100th year anniversary this July, turning from a park to a fenced cricket oval, and later to this picturesque arena with open-stands with flood-lights.\nIt’s not a surprise that the idea to host a Prime Minister’s XI fixture at this ground stuck to the then prime minister Robert Menzies in 1953; it’s a surprise that it didn’t strike earlier as cricket and politics in not only entwined in Australia, it can be even said that very idea of Australia was forged by cricket. Such was the importance of the summer game to this country.\nCricket gave Australia a sense of national identity. A lovely little story captures the pre-nationalism era in Australia. A ship carrying a motley lot of Australian cricketers to England hit a storm in the seas in 1877. When Alec Bannerman was asked by Fred Spofforth, Australia’s premier fast bowler nicknamed the ‘Demon’, who would he save if the ship sank, the reply came swiftly, “First my brother Charles and then you”. Spofforth queried, “What about the Victorians?” and Alec went, “I would let them drown!” It was a period of parochialism in Australian cricket and society but things were to change soon. Cricket played a huge role in it.\nThat period also reflected Australia’s affinity with England. It was the days when Britannia ruled Australian culture. In his retirement speech, Spofforth said it would be a privilege if England gave him a chance to play. Billy Murdoch, who captained Australia in the match where the Ashes legend originated, later represented England against South Africa and on his death, was buried in England. Albert Trott too played for England. Australia hadn’t yet cut the umbilical cord with England.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was around the end of 1880’s that cricket helped shape the idea of Australia. The colonies which never did anything together were beginning to assemble under the umbrella of cricket. In 1878, in their cricketing tour of England, they had a Tasmanian, and then in the follow-up tours they had three South Australians and six New South Welshmen and five Victorians.\nWould Australian nationalism have suffered if they had lost in those early games?\nGideon Haigh, a cricket historian and a writer, thinks so. “Every country tends to value those things they are successful at. If we hadn’t been a not so successful cricket country, if we had lost the Oval Test of 1882, if we had lost the Ashes series of 1897, perhaps we wouldn’t have regarded cricket as fundamentally important as we do,” Haigh had told this newspaper.\n“It’s amazing and significant how early victories can be when you are searching for a sense of nation, of national identity. The Australians were able to accomplish as a single entity what the squabbling colonies were unable to attain politically was a significant step.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe 1897 series against England was a very important landmark in cricket and society. It coincided with a series of pre-federation conferences in which the individual colonies of Australia were trying to reach an agreement at some sort of a federation. In that 1897 tour, Harry Trott’s side of Australians thrashed England 4-1 and that convincing margin of victory was toasted back in Australia.\nThe Bulletin, a very old Australian magazine which finally shut down in 2008, hailed that victory as “as being more to enhance the cause of Australian nationality than could be achieved by miles of erudite essays and impassioned appeal”.\nWhen the Australians toured England in 1899, they adopted for the first time ever, a motley of sage green and gold and even flew it in a flag over their headquarters at the inns of Court Hotel. Australianism now had an emotional visual construct as well.\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that Australia didn’t have many social and cultural narratives. It’s a modern nation. Or as Gideon says, “It’s a geographical construct. We didn’t have any political identity until 1901. Like what CLR James wrote of cricket in the Caribbean, here cricket provided us access to a readymade culture and helped us assert our superiority in certain controlled and limited respects.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 1901, through the process of Federation, six separate British self-governing colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia formed one nation. Many of the Federation fathers actually learnt how to run the country through their experience of running cricket. The first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton, was an umpire and a former vice-president of New South Wales cricket Association. As an umpire he was famous for stopping a riot against a visiting English side in a game against New South Wales in 1879.\n“Post-Federation cricket has a particular cache, because it represents values held dear, it’s national in a new-born nation, it’s traditional in a land with few traditions. It’s imperial in a country where the links of Empire mattered, and it’s also white in a region of the world where immediately beyond Australia’s shores was not. And I think Australian cricket success allowed the country to parade both its purity and the necessity of maintaining that freedom from racial contaminants,” Haigh says.\nThe Bulletin was a magazine which was fiercely behind the white Australia policy and sought to use cricket to promote its ideas. Its strap line at one point of time was “Australia for the white man and China for the Chow.”\nThings are changing these days of course. Cricket now is at the next step of fusing Australia. With the inclusion of the likes of Usman Khawaja, it’s taking the integrated idea of Australia to the next level, trying outreach programmes with the South Asian population interested in cricket. As always, with Australia, cricket is at the forefront of silent revolutions."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/sharad-pawar-party-first-challenge-civic-polls-new-cadre-9698445/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "In its first election after the split in the party, the NCP (SP) led by Sharad Pawar had tasted success in the Lok Sabha, winning eight of the 10 seats it contested. But that euphoria proved short lived, with the recent Assembly polls seeing it fall to only 10 out of the 87 seats it contested.\nThe grandmaster of Indian politics, Pawar has now been outsmarted by nephew Ajit Pawar fair and square – losing a majority of his MLAs and MPs to him first, then the party name and symbol (though the legal fight over this continues), and now public support.\nGiven the clear majority of the Mahayuti, the only chance the NCP (SP) may get to prove its relevance – and forestall a possible exodus – in the next five years would be the civic elections, which have been due in the state for a while.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPolitical Pulse | Disquiet in Congress over EVM blame, internal survey showed party was losing Lok Sabha gains in Maharashtra\nIn elections held to 27 municipal corporations between 2014 and 2018, the undivided NCP had got 6.95% of the votes. But in semi-urban and rural local bodies, its vote share was as much as 15% and 21% respectively.\nA day after the results, Pawar was at the memorial of former chief minister Y B Chavan, his political mentor, in Karad. In his first remarks on the results, the 83-year-old said: “I will not sit idle and will continue to meet people and resolve their issues.” He added that his strategy would include grooming a new generation that believes in “my ideology”.\nA close associate of Pawar and NCP (SP) general secretary Jaideo Gaikwad admitted that the party needed a roadmap for the near future as well as going forward. However, he played down the Assembly poll setback saying the NCP (SP) would continue to fight on.\n“Anyone can say whatever they want about the future of the NCP (SP) and Pawar. He is very clear he will continue to lead the struggle for the ideology he follows,” said Gaikwad. As per the NCP (SP), this is the ideology of secularism and social equality, as espoused by Chhatrapati Shahu, Mahatma Phule and Babasaheb Ambedkar, and stands in contrast to the BJP’s Hindutva.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | MVA tensions rise as Congress leaders pitch for going solo amid Uddhav Sena heat\nPolitical observer Prakash Pawar, former head of the Political Science department at Shivaji University, said Pawar can always argue that the state elections were not a referendum on him as he himself was not in the race. However, he pointed out, the window for the octogenarian is closing very fast. “Pawar is unlikely to be active in the next general elections, more so because of his age.”\nAccording to sources, the NCP founder is set to focus on first rallying together the 10 MLAs and eight MPs he is left with, apart from the party leaders who lost in the recent elections. As long as he has this numerical strength, his importance in state and national politics cannot be said to have ended, said a source.\nThe next step, over which talks have already begun, NCP (SP) leaders said, is grooming a rung of new leaders. One reason identified behind the NCP (SP)’s wipeout in the state is the absence of strong candidates in its ranks after the party split.\nAbout the civic polls, Gaikwad said: “While he won’t be directly involved, Pawar will oversee the party performance to help strengthen the base.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nRead more | What next for Sharad Pawar after Ajit wins the battle of NCP, takes the bragging rights\nAs another source pointed out, Pawar may not have much choice in this as there is no strong leader he can pass on his baton to. Daughter Supriya Sule is more of a Delhi face and has been an MP since she joined politics in 2006. Two family members personally backed by Pawar didn’t perform to his expectations in the recent Assembly polls, with grandnephew Rohit scraping through by 1,243 votes in the Karjat-Jamkhed seat, and grandnephew Yugendra losing by 1 lakh-plus votes to Ajit Pawar in the prestigious seat of Baramati.\nIncidentally, during the Assembly election campaign, Pawar had hinted at retirement from parliamentary politics altogether, citing his age. “I had declared in the past that I will not contest any general elections and now will think whether to continue in the Rajya Sabha after the present term,” he had said.\nThe irony is that while the NCP (SP) might now find it hard to send him back to the Rajya Sabha when he retires in 2026, Pawar may want to hold on to some national presence to keep his party afloat.\nNCP leader Pradeep Deshmukh said the united party’s strength was always western Maharashtra and small pockets across the state. “The Assembly elections show that voters have rejected the NCP (SP) and are behind our leader Ajit Pawar. They will continue to support the party that can ensure their progress,” he said, claiming that many NCP (SP) leaders are ready to switch sides.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was wrong to forecast the end of the Maha Vikas Aghadi by one election alone, countered state Congress spokesperson Anant Gadgil, pointing out that the situation was completely different just five months ago in the Lok Sabha elections. However, Gadgil admitted, a lot rests on the civic polls. “I hope we improve our performance,” he said, calling for “proper seat-sharing and coordination” between the alliance partners.\nA Shiv Sena (UBT) leader, who did not want to be quoted, said it was not the party’s place to tell the NCP (SP) anything as they were in the same boat, but that a rethink on the coalition had begun. “We have nothing against alliance partners, but in the long run, a party should have strong cadre, which can only be activated if the civic elections are contested independently,” he said."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-brazil-exposed-the-g20-crisis-9698436/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "As the fading graffiti on the streets of New Delhi archives the memory of India’s G20 presidency in 2023, the elite club concluded its 19th Leaders’ Summit on November 18-19 in Rio de Janeiro under Brazil’s leadership. The summit ended successfully with a joint declaration but left a bitter aftertaste. What was most surprising is that the “premier forum for international economic cooperation” continued to call itself G20 (19 countries and the European Union), and not G21, despite including the African Union as a permanent member last year. This act of not renaming the forum faced criticisms as it demonstrated the reluctance of the elite club to genuinely include Africa in global decision-making. However, the Brazilian presidency, under the theme “Building a just world and a sustainable planet”, raised some fundamental concerns and exposed some diplomatic cracks.\nFirstly, the summit was not attended by the heads of Russia and Saudi Arabia. While Vladimir Putin said that his presence would “wreck” the summit because of the ICC arrest warrant issued against his name, the last-minute cancellation by the Saudi Crown Prince generated speculations. More importantly, the final declaration was not entirely endorsed by Argentina because of President Javier Milei’s ideological opposition to the sustainable development agenda, welfare spending, and regulation of hate speech on social media. Further, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, questioned the G20’s effectiveness in managing the current global crises and warned of possible trade wars as Donald Trump reenters the White House. Other Western powers such as Germany, the UK and Canada also criticised the communique for its weak language on the Ukraine war. On the other hand, the G20 affirmed Palestine’s right to self-determination and advocated for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. Looking at this shaky consensus on geopolitics, one cannot help but ask if the G20 is on the verge of an implosion.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSecondly, the prime outcome of the summit was the launch of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty (GAAHP), supported by 148 signatories, which includes 82 countries, international organisations, financial institutions and philanthropic bodies. It is going to be an independent platform, open to broader membership. It aims to lift 500 million people globally out of hunger and poverty by 2030 through initiatives like cash transfers, school meals, improved access to microfinance, access to water, and similar targeted interventions for social protection. While the launch of this alliance is a welcome decision, NGOs like Oxfam have pointed out that transparency in governance, clear safeguards vis-a-vis private-sector control over policy-making and inclusion of voices of civil society are crucial for its success. How the GAAHP initiative unfolds remains to be seen.\nThirdly, the G20 declaration did not mince words. It acknowledged that “inequality within and among countries is at the root of most global challenges that we face.” It committed to addressing inequalities and called for “social, economic and political inclusion and empowerment of all” to achieve ethnic and racial equality. A crucial step in this direction is the endorsement of progressive taxation and cooperative engagement to effectively tax “ultra-high-net-worth individuals.” While the US, Germany and Argentina opposed the wealth tax proposal, anti-poverty activists globally lauded the move as “a historic decision” for responding to “people’s demands worldwide to tackle extreme inequality, hunger and climate breakdown.”\nFourthly, the call to bring “transformative reform” in the UNSC to ensure greater representation, particularly of countries from Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, is noteworthy. In addition, the group also reiterated its earlier commitments to reform the international financial architecture and institutions like the World Bank, Multilateral Development Banks and WTO. Reform of the global governance institutions to ensure substantive representation has been a long-standing demand. Observers have persistently pointed out how conditionalities imposed by Bretton Woods institutions like the IMF have resulted in “social, environmental and economic catastrophes” in countries of the Global South.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFinally, the G20 leaders also pledged to increase climate finance from billions to trillions, without presenting a clear roadmap. They hoped that this commitment would boost the CoP29 negotiations in Baku and culminate into a successful New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance. However, the outcome of CoP29 turned out to be an “optical illusion” as rich countries agreed to contribute only $300 billion by 2035 to help poor countries deal with the impact of climate change. On the related question of dealing with the debt crisis of low- and middle-income countries, the G20 reaffirmed faith in its existing Common Framework which, as the case of Zambia revealed, is a flawed one and furthers economic instability.\nMOST READ\n1\nThe JEE system is broken. Here’s how India can produce employable engineers\n2\nDear Jaguar, now that you have picked the ‘inclusive’ lane, stick to it\n3\n‘Constitutionalism’ has become another word for extending colonial legacies\n4\nNovember 29, 1984, Forty Years Ago: A R Antulay expelled from Congress\n5\nPratap Bhanu Mehta writes: Why Opposition’s ‘democracy in danger’ pitch cuts little ice with voters\nAs a contender for the voice of the Global South, Brazil has struck the right chord with the pressing concerns of the people and the planet. The launch of the GAAHP and the endorsement of taxing the rich are two crucial steps. Interestingly, while the Brazilian government hid its poor neighbourhoods or favelas behind colourful walls during the summit, it also held a Favelas20 to engage with voices from these marginal neighbourhoods. Unlike India, observers commended Brazil for engaging with civil society. However, the G20 in India was a diplomatic triumph as the chair could build a consensus, even though the final declaration was considered “compromised”, “uninspiring and underwhelming.”\nBrazil exposed the crisis of the G20. The return of the Trump administration will impact the forum’s existing commitments towards tackling climate, multilateralism and trade, among other issues. In turn, diplomatic disruptors like Argentine president Milei who endorsed cuts in government spending are likely to thrive. Moreover, the position of the US and Germany on the wealth tax, and the CoP29 negotiations reveal the West’s unwillingness to deal with people’s just demands. The situation is the same when it comes to debt justice. The challenge from a growing BRICS is also a serious concern for a divided G20 today. In a world of multiple intersecting crises — wars, hunger, widening inequalities, unprecedented forced migration, health emergencies, debt and climate crisis — it is perhaps time to rethink the relevance of informal clubs dictating global governance.\nThe writer is assistant professor of Political Science at GITAM University, Bengaluru"

However, given their experience of 2017, when the first Trump Administration on January 27 issued an executive order barring immigrants and non-immigrant travellers from seven majority Muslim nations from entering the US for 90 days.\nMIT urged the students to not pay heed to the rumours or speculations.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It is still too early to determine what the immediate impacts may be on immigration and visa issues since the new Congress will be sworn in at the beginning of January, and our new President will be sworn in on January 20, 2025,” David C Elwell, Associate Dean and Director, MIT International Students Office, said.\nNew Executive Orders that may impact travel and visa processing may be implemented on or after that date, he wrote.\n“In addition, election transitions also impact staffing levels at US Embassies/Consulates abroad, which could impact entry visa processing times,” Elwell said.\nMIT said students who would need to apply for a new entry visa in order to return to the US must prepare for an extensive processing time and have a backup plan if they must travel abroad and wait for a new entry visa to be issued.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAny processing delays could impact students’ ability to return to the US as planned, it noted. The Trump Transition Team did not respond to a PTI question on this issue.\n“The Office of Global Affairs recommends that our UMass Amherst international community — including all international students, scholars, faculty and staff under UMass immigration sponsorship — strongly consider returning to the United States before the presidential inauguration day of January 20, 2025, if they are planning on traveling internationally during the winter holiday break,” the University of Massachusetts wrote in a post on Instagram.\nThe varsity said this was not a mandate from it but a recommendation based on previous experience with travel bans enacted in the first Trump Administration.\n“… the Office of Global Affairs is making this advisory out of an abundance of caution to hopefully prevent any possible travel disruption to members of our international community,” it said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We are not able to speculate on what a travel ban will look like if enacted, nor can we speculate on what particular countries or regions of the world may or may not be affected,” the university added.\nSeveral other universities have issued similar advisories.\nWesleyan University in Indiana urged international students to be on campus by January 19.\n“The safest way to avoid difficulty re-entering the country is to be physically present in the US on January 19th and the days thereafter of the spring semester,” wrote Wesleyan’s Office of International Student Affairs in an email last Monday.\nYale University held a virtual session with its international students on this issue.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We are following up our post-election discussion by hosting another session on how US Presidential Elections have shaped US immigration policy and what we are watching for in a second Trump presidency,” it said.\nThe university has over 6,000 international students and scholars from more than 120 countries."

        "content": "Amid controversy over the Tripura government’s move to turn the Pushpavant Palace in Agartala into a luxury hotel under the Taj Group, state Cabinet spokesperson Sushanta Chowdhury said the building is a government asset, so the dispensation has the right to take a decision in this regard.\nSpeaking to reporters, the minister said in Agartala on Friday evening, “This palace used to be the property of the kings and royal family during monarchial times. Since the merger of Tripura with the Indian Union, it is a government asset and the government may take any decision on its property.”\nTo the opposition from royal scion-turned-politician Pradyot Kishore Manikya Debbarma, the minister said that formerly royal structures and properties were doing business in the state, including setting up marriage halls. This is seen as an oblique reference to some of the assets of Pradyot Kishore and his sister Pragya Debbarman, which are used to host weddings.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChowdhury reiterated that he did not wish to hurt anyone’s sentiments but only wished to state that discussions – under Chief Minister Dr Manik Saha – are on with the Tata group regarding setting up a hotel at the Pushpavant Palace but no decision has been taken yet.\nEarlier this month, Debbarma had opposed the proposal. “I want development of tourism sector in the state. If you (government) want to make a hotel in some other place, I shall give you land. This has happened earlier as well. Our historical places were renamed, status was changed. For how long will you do this? I urge the people of all communities, who have respect and knowledge of history and culture, to oppose such a move,” he said.\nChowdhury said the palace is currently being renovated to ensure that it meets earthquake-resistant standards and reassured that the government does not have plans to demolish the structure.\nHistory of Pushpavant Palace\nBuilt in 1917 by the then king Birendra Kishore Manikya Debbarman, Pushpavant Palace was the Governor’s House till 2018 when the Raj Bhavan was inaugurated in the New Capital Complex. The initial plan was to redevelop the palace as a digital museum.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen the erstwhile princely state merged with the Indian Union in 1949, the palace was handed over to the government by the then regent queen Rajmata Kanchan Prabha Devi to accommodate the Governor.\nPradyot Kishore said that contrary to the understanding between the royal family and the government to accommodate the governor, he came to know of plans for a five-star hotel without consulting the people or considering their culture or sentiments.\n“Everything can’t be done for money, for profit. I completely oppose it and I am telling the government to rethink the decision or else we have to hit the streets,” Debbarma said in a video message on social media.\nBefore coming to power in 2018, the BJP-IPFT alliance had promised to convert the palace into Maharaj Birendra Kishore Manikya Museum and Cultural Centre. Later, discussions began to hand over a portion of the property to the Taj Group to convert it into a luxury hotel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUjjayanta Palace, the former abode of Tripura’s Manikya monarchs till the merger with the Indian Union, served as the state Legislative Assembly till 2011 and is now the state museum.\nMalancha Niwas, near the Pushpavant Palace, is still standing and parts of it were recently renovated by the descendants of the erstwhile royal family while other royal structures like the ‘Laal Mahal’ were demolished during the tenure of the Left Front government."

Chunky revealed that he didn’t want to invite his daughter to the sets of his films, as he was going through a difficult time professionally.

I started dealing in land, buying properties. Imagine going house to house, trying to do things. I kept my ego inside and said that I need to survive. So, I learnt a lot during this process. I have been  flat broke,” he said.\nChunky further added, “I didn’t want to take money from my parents. If you are a guy and you started off your career, you can’t go back and ask for money. I have never let them know this was happening, and even never let my wife know how much I have or don’t have.”\nRecently, in an interview on Raj Shamani’s podcast, Ananya shared her own perspective on her dad’s troubles. “My dad was having a low phase when I was born. He was a huge actor in the ’80s and ’90s, but after that, he started doing different kinds of work. There were long periods of time when he wasn’t working. I would see him sitting at home. When I was a child, I must’ve been to a film set only once or twice with him. It wasn’t like he was very busy and doing lots of work. People weren’t standing outside our house to get a glimpse of him, I didn’t grow up seeing that,” she said.\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

        "content": "Meitei radical organisation Arambai Tenggol’s supremo Korou Nganba Khuman and Kuki militants are under the radar of the National Investigation Agency, which has been tasked with probing four cases of attacks on security forces and an IED explosion in strife-torn Manipur.\nThe cases include looting of arms and ammunition from the 1st Manipur Rifles complex in Imphal, attack on Indian Reserve Battalion post in Moreh and IED explosion in Bishnupur.\nThe Counter Terrorism and Counter Radicalisation Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs has recently ordered the NIA to undertake further investigation of the four cases.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe cases have recently been transferred by the Supreme court from the NIA Court in Imphal to NIA Special Court in Guwahati.\nA copy of the transfer petition filed by the NIA before the Supreme Court said, “The first case involving Khuman is related to an incident that occurred on November 1 last year when a large number of Arambai Tenggol members led by him and armed with sophisticated weapons, wearing camouflaged uniforms, and black colour shirts coming in many light vehicles gathered at Palace Compound in Imphal East district on a call given in Facebook page Korou Nganba Khuman in Manipuri language which literally translates to ‘please come all brave brothers let us teach them all a final lesson today’.” “When they were stopped by (personnel of) the Imphal East police station at the palace gate, the group fired at police, overpowered the local police and proceeded through Sanjenthong Bridge towards Imphal West side in many light vehicles,” it said.\n“The central government has received information from the Government of Manipur regarding registration of an FIR at Porompat in Imphal East district dated 1/11/2023 under Sections 147, 148, 149, 186, 188, 307, 379 A, 395, 504, 505, 506, 34 of IPC, Sec 18 of UA(P) Act, Sec 6 (1) (a) of Official Secrets Act, Sec 25 (1-B) of Arms Act,” an FIR filed by NIA Imphal said.\n“The central government is of the opinion that a scheduled offence under the NIA Act 2008 has been committed and having regarded the gravity of the offence and ramifications on national security, it is required to be investigated by the NIA in accordance with the NIA Act,” it added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe second case involving Khuman is of another incident that happened on the same day at 6 pm.\nThe petition stated that a large number of AT members led by its chief rushed in from the northwestern gate and attacked the 1st Manipur Riffles Battalion in Imphal.\n“They ransacked government office belongings including vehicles and looted the arms and ammunition from the 1st MR Battalion. After the arrival of reinforcement of the security forces including civil police, Assam Rifles and CRPF, the assailants escaped with arms and ammunition looted from security personnel,” it said.\nOne Mutum Rajesh Singh (25) of Lilong Chajing Mamang Leikai and Langthabal Kunja of Kyamgei Shantipur were arrested on November 30, 2023 in connection with the case.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnother case that brought Kuki militants under the radar of the NIA involved an armed attack on an IRB post in Moreh in Tengnoupal district in January this year.\n“On January 17, 2024, some heavily armed suspected Kuki militants attacked the IRB post at Ima Kondong Lairembi in Moreh using bombs and firearms thereby injuring one IRB personnel. IRB also retaliated and thus encounter ensued between unknown suspected Kuki militants who are waging war against the national security forces and IRB personnel,” the petition stated.\nIt said the fierce exchange of fire spread to many other parts of Moreh town and one rifleman Somorjit Meetei attained martyrdom and two other IRB personnel were injured. No accused were arrested in the case.\nThe fourth case was related to an IED bomb blast at Phougakchao Ikhai in Bishnupur district on June 21 last year by suspected militants in which three persons were injured and houses and government properties were damaged.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOne Seiminlun Gangte of Churachandpur, and two others, identified as Md Noor Hussain and Md Islauddin, have been arrested in connection with the case.\nMore than 250 people have been killed and thousands rendered homeless in ethnic violence between Imphal Valley-based Meiteis and adjoining hills-based Kuki-Zo groups since May last year."

        "content": "Relentless rain forced an early abandonment of the opening day’s play of the two-day pink-ball game between the Indians and the Prime Minister’s XI at Manuka Oval in Canberra. India had a photo-op with the Australian PM, Anthony Albanese, gave him a floppy sun-hat with their autographs, and soon left the arena. The setting – the game and the capital city – though allows us to dwell on the importance of cricket to Australians.\nCanberra is a city of compromise. A city that was birthed, constructed, designed as a balm to developing wounds in the Australian political society. More than hundred years ago, in 1913, due to political rivalries between New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria, the fight was one to where to have the capital and to locate the parliament house.\nOnce it was deemed that the capital had to be at least 100 miles (160 kms) away from Sydney, the Canberra region, inhabited by the Ngunnawal people for thousands of years, was finally chosen. A worldwide designing contest too was undertaken, and the American architect couple Marion Mahony Griffin and her husband Walter Burley won, and dreamed up the capital in their imagination.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Manuka Oval celebrated its 100th year anniversary this July, turning from a park to a fenced cricket oval, and later to this picturesque arena with open-stands with flood-lights.\nIt’s not a surprise that the idea to host a Prime Minister’s XI fixture at this ground stuck to the then prime minister Robert Menzies in 1953; it’s a surprise that it didn’t strike earlier as cricket and politics in not only entwined in Australia, it can be even said that very idea of Australia was forged by cricket. Such was the importance of the summer game to this country.\nCricket gave Australia a sense of national identity. A lovely little story captures the pre-nationalism era in Australia. A ship carrying a motley lot of Australian cricketers to England hit a storm in the seas in 1877. When Alec Bannerman was asked by Fred Spofforth, Australia’s premier fast bowler nicknamed the ‘Demon’, who would he save if the ship sank, the reply came swiftly, “First my brother Charles and then you”. Spofforth queried, “What about the Victorians?” and Alec went, “I would let them drown!” It was a period of parochialism in Australian cricket and society but things were to change soon. Cricket played a huge role in it.\nThat period also reflected Australia’s affinity with England. It was the days when Britannia ruled Australian culture. In his retirement speech, Spofforth said it would be a privilege if England gave him a chance to play. Billy Murdoch, who captained Australia in the match where the Ashes legend originated, later represented England against South Africa and on his death, was buried in England. Albert Trott too played for England. Australia hadn’t yet cut the umbilical cord with England.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was around the end of 1880’s that cricket helped shape the idea of Australia. The colonies which never did anything together were beginning to assemble under the umbrella of cricket. In 1878, in their cricketing tour of England, they had a Tasmanian, and then in the follow-up tours they had three South Australians and six New South Welshmen and five Victorians.\nWould Australian nationalism have suffered if they had lost in those early games?\nGideon Haigh, a cricket historian and a writer, thinks so. “Every country tends to value those things they are successful at. If we hadn’t been a not so successful cricket country, if we had lost the Oval Test of 1882, if we had lost the Ashes series of 1897, perhaps we wouldn’t have regarded cricket as fundamentally important as we do,” Haigh had told this newspaper.\n“It’s amazing and significant how early victories can be when you are searching for a sense of nation, of national identity. The Australians were able to accomplish as a single entity what the squabbling colonies were unable to attain politically was a significant step.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe 1897 series against England was a very important landmark in cricket and society. It coincided with a series of pre-federation conferences in which the individual colonies of Australia were trying to reach an agreement at some sort of a federation. In that 1897 tour, Harry Trott’s side of Australians thrashed England 4-1 and that convincing margin of victory was toasted back in Australia.\nThe Bulletin, a very old Australian magazine which finally shut down in 2008, hailed that victory as “as being more to enhance the cause of Australian nationality than could be achieved by miles of erudite essays and impassioned appeal”.\nWhen the Australians toured England in 1899, they adopted for the first time ever, a motley of sage green and gold and even flew it in a flag over their headquarters at the inns of Court Hotel. Australianism now had an emotional visual construct as well.\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that Australia didn’t have many social and cultural narratives. It’s a modern nation. Or as Gideon says, “It’s a geographical construct. We didn’t have any political identity until 1901. Like what CLR James wrote of cricket in the Caribbean, here cricket provided us access to a readymade culture and helped us assert our superiority in certain controlled and limited respects.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 1901, through the process of Federation, six separate British self-governing colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia formed one nation. Many of the Federation fathers actually learnt how to run the country through their experience of running cricket. The first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton, was an umpire and a former vice-president of New South Wales cricket Association. As an umpire he was famous for stopping a riot against a visiting English side in a game against New South Wales in 1879.\n“Post-Federation cricket has a particular cache, because it represents values held dear, it’s national in a new-born nation, it’s traditional in a land with few traditions. It’s imperial in a country where the links of Empire mattered, and it’s also white in a region of the world where immediately beyond Australia’s shores was not. And I think Australian cricket success allowed the country to parade both its purity and the necessity of maintaining that freedom from racial contaminants,” Haigh says.\nThe Bulletin was a magazine which was fiercely behind the white Australia policy and sought to use cricket to promote its ideas. Its strap line at one point of time was “Australia for the white man and China for the Chow.”\nThings are changing these days of course. Cricket now is at the next step of fusing Australia. With the inclusion of the likes of Usman Khawaja, it’s taking the integrated idea of Australia to the next level, trying outreach programmes with the South Asian population interested in cricket. As always, with Australia, cricket is at the forefront of silent revolutions."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/canada-student-visa-applications-9698473/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "In a departure from the norm, Canadian education consultants in Punjab are advising aspiring international students to secure offer letters from Canadian colleges and universities but delay their study visa applications for a while. The unusual guidance comes amid ongoing changes to the Canada visa application process, which have left students and consultants waiting for clarity from the embassy.\n“Obtaining an offer letter reserves a seat in the college or university of your choice. However, I strongly advise against submitting a study permit application at this moment,” Tirath Singh, a senior consultant with Jalandhar-based Pinnacle Education, which specialises in Canadian study programmes, said.\nCanada has recently announced several changes to its international student program, including discontinuing the Student Direct Stream (SDS) pathway for students.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTirath explained that the new changes are yet to be reflected on the Canadian embassy’s portal but consultants are continuing to process applications under various categories. Tirath explained that whenever there is any update in visa rules, it is usually accompanied by a lot of confusion. “Until the embassy provides written clarity on the new rules, it is better to wait,” he said.\nExpress Explained | With Canada’s SDS program ending, the path for Indian students to secure visas\n“Rushing to apply without this clarity could lead to unnecessary complications as the same happened last year in August when there was an update regarding the IELTS score. Earlier it was perceived that 6.5 bands were required but when the embassy updated it on the portal, there was proper clarity that overall six bands were required in the four volumes,” he explained.\nIn this period of uncertainty, students should secure offer letters “immediately”, Tirath said, because with increasing competition for admissions, obtaining an offer letter now ensures a reserved spot in the programme.\n“Only minimal payments requested by the colleges should be made to reserve the seat. Students should hold off on additional payments for the chosen courses and visa applications. Students should carefully choose from the list of 970 courses recently released by various institutions, prioritising programmes that offer better job prospects post-graduation,” said Tirath, adding that he recommended that students use the waiting period to strengthen their financial documentation. He also highlighted the option of deferring applications to the 2025 intake, giving students additional time to improve their financial and academic profiles.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Proof of four months’ required funds in the account will be crucial for visa approval and having funds in the account for longer than the stipulated time could be advantageous,” consultant Gurpreet Singh, who is based in Kapurthala, said.\nThe consultants suggested that updates are likely to appear on the embassy portal in one or two weeks. If there are no updates in the coming weeks, students should consult experienced consultants for advice, they added.\n“The advice to delay visa applications comes as some consultants push students to apply immediately,” Gurpreet said, urging students to rely on genuine consultants who prioritise long-term success over short-term gains."

        "content": "A man allegedly threw a liquid at former Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal during his padyatra in South Delhi’s Sheikh Sarai area on Saturday evening. The man was detained by security personnel present at the spot.\nThe incident took place when Kejriwal, with Greater Kailash MLA and Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, was walking in a narrow lane, greeting people. Police personnel had controlled the crowd by placing a rope on both sides of the two leaders.\nThe Delhi police, in a statement, said that the padyatra organised by AAP took place without permission in the Malviya Nagar area, with Kejriwal as the chief guest. “Despite proper police deployment for crowd control, at around 5:50 PM, Ashok Jha, a bus marshal from Khanpur Depot, attempted to throw water on Kejriwal while he was greeting followers. The attempt was immediately foiled as police in close proximity apprehended Jha and detained him. The motives behind his actions are under investigation,” DCP South, Ankit Chauhan told The Indian Express.\nDescribing the incident, Bharadwaj claimed that the attacker tried to “throw spirit” on Kejriwal and attempts were allegedly being made to kill him because another person had come with matches who threatened to burn the former CM alive. “They were successful in throwing the spirit but they were not able to light the match,” Saurabh Bharadwaj added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a video of the incident, Kejriwal can be seen walking in front, Delhi minister Bharadwaj a few steps behind him. Security personnel are also inside the cordon created using the rope. As he moves forward, the man reaches out and throws a liquid on Kejriwal. The liquid also falls on two security personnel.\n“BJP is upset after failing to maintain law and order in Delhi. BJP attacked Arvind Kejriwal for raising questions on law and order. ⁠Amit Shah’s failure is obvious. If a former CM is not safe in the capital, where will the common man go? Delhi is facing a complete law and order breakdown under BJP’s rule. This is the third attack on him in the past 35 days. He was attacked in Vikaspuri and Nangloi earlier,” AAP said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the man who threw the liquid at Kejriwal was associated with BJP.\nDelhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Elections are held across the country, and leaders, whether good or bad, participate in campaigns under varying levels of security. However, such bizarre incidents occur only with Arvind Kejriwal during every assembly election…The incident of throwing water on Arvind Kejriwal is like old wine in a new bottle…Delhiites are asking, why does this always happen with Arvind Kejriwal?”"

Priyanka won the seat by trouncing the CPI’s Sathyan Mokeri by over 4.10 lakh votes.\nHere is a look at the parliamentary stints of some key members of the Nehru-Gandhi family since the period of Jawaharlal Nehru.\nJawaharlal Nehru\nADVERTISEMENT\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, remained in office continuously over multiple terms for nearly 17 years since Independence — the longest premiership in India so far. Nehru’s contributions to Parliament and the making of a modern India are widely considered to be seminal.\nNehru had moved the Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946 – from which the Preamble to the Indian Constitution springs. He had also moved the first amendment in Parliament to the Constitution on May 16, 1951, adding “public order” and “friendly relations with foreign states” to Article 19 (2), which contained the restrictions to the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1) (a). The amendment also added the word “reasonable” to restrictions, thus laying down that any curbs must be reasonable.\nBetween 1952 and 1957, Nehru also steered four legislations to amend family laws to ensure gender equality. These were Hindu Marriage Bill, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Bill, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Bill and Hindu Succession Bill. With these laws, major reforms like the abolition of polygamy and the provision of equal property rights to daughters were made.\nAs the Law Minister, B R Ambedkar had looked at reforming family laws, but opposition from within the Congress and other parties had delayed the Hindu Code Bill from becoming a law. This had led to Ambedkar’s resignation. Nehru eventually saw the reform through in Parliament. He, however, also drew criticism for not reforming the Muslim personal law, leaving it to the community.\nFeroze Gandhi\nADVERTISEMENT\nNehru’s son-in-law Feroze Gandhi, who became an MP in 1952, was also a noted parliamentarian. In 1956, he introduced a private member’s Bill that later became the Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act 1956. It is due to the passage of this Bill that the parliamentary proceedings started getting reported.\nIt was Feroze who brought the Mundhra scandal to light when his father-in-law Nehru was the PM.\nOn December 16, 1957, he said in the Lok Sabha that an investment of Rs 1.25 crore had been made by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) in the companies of Haridas Mundhra, an industrialist and stock speculator. In his speech, he did not fight shy of taking on his own party’s government led by Nehru. His intervention led to the setting up of the MC Chagla Commission, which indicted the then Finance Minister TT Krishnamachari over the row, who had to resign.\nFeroze was elected from the Raebareli constituency in Uttar Pradesh in 1952 and 1957. He passed away in 1960.\nIndira Gandhi\nADVERTISEMENT\nNehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi, who also went on to become the PM, steered some important laws in Parliament. Indira’s early prime ministerial stint saw her putting her weight behind two Bills aimed at shifting policy towards the left. These included the Bill to nationalise banks and the Bill to abolish privy purses for the erstwhile princely states’ rulers.\nFourteen private banks containing 85% of the country’s bank deposits were nationalised through an Ordinance in 1969. The Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking) Bill, 1969, became law on August 9, 1969, and replaced the Ordinance. In 1971, the Indira government amended the Constitution through the 26th Constitutional Amendment to abolish privy purses for the former rulers that was a part of an undertaking to get them to accede to and merge with India.\nEarlier, Indira had tried to abolish privy purses in 1970 through a failed constitutional amendment, and then through a Presidential order that was struck down by a court. She made their abolition an issue in the 1971 Lok Sabha elections, and ensured it by amending the Constitution soon after winning the polls.\nIndira then also started bringing legislation aimed at centralising power. In 1971, the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) was passed to give the government increased powers to detain a person on grounds of security of the state, defence of the country, maintenance of supplies of essential services, etc. It became notorious during the Emergency of 1975-77, brought by Indira, as most Opposition leaders were jailed under its provisions. It was repealed by the Janata Party government in 1978.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDuring the Emergency, Indira was instrumental in the passage of the Prevention of Publication of Objectionable Matters Act, 1976, which empowered the government to prohibit publications on all the grounds related to Article 19 (2), and to confiscate or shut down printing presses and forfeit security deposit for printing “objectionable matter”.\nWith the Opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency, the Indira government passed in Parliament the Constitution (Thirty-eighth Amendment) Act, which barred judicial review of the Emergency, and the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, which stipulated that the election of the Prime Minister could not be challenged in the Supreme Court. The Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act made changes to a range of laws, taking away the judiciary’s right to hear election petitions, widening the authority of the Union to encroach on State subjects, gave Parliament unbridled power to amend the Constitution with no judicial review possible, and made any law passed by Parliament to implement any or all directive principles of state policy immune to judicial review. The words “socialist” and “secular” were inserted in the Preamble during the Emergency. Most of the changes were reversed by the Janata government through the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978.\nSanjay Gandhi\nIndira’s son Sanjay Gandhi was elected to the Lok Sabha from Amethi in 1980 but died within months in an air crash. He had landed in various controversies by becoming an unelected power centre during the Emergency, imposing family planning targets. He was also alleged to be behind the violent demolition drive undertaken in Delhi’s Turkman Gate area.\nRajiv Gandhi\nRajiv Gandhi became an MP from Amethi in 1981 following the death of his younger brother Sanjay. He was re-elected as an MP in 1984, when he also became the PM after his mother Indira’s assassination. He continued to be the Amethi MP till he was assassinated in 1991.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRajiv’s first landmark legislation as the PM was the anti-defection law that he brought to reverse the “Aaya Ram Gaya Ram” nature of politics. The 52nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1985 provided for disqualification of a legislator for switching sides unless the party split with at least 1/3rd of its legislature party breaking away, or merged with another party with the consent of at least 2/3rd of its MPs. This move, seen as an attack on political corruption, earned Rajiv the moniker “Mr Clean”, which the Bofors scandal would undo within years.\nRajiv also courted controversy for his decision to overturn the Supreme Court’s Shah Bano verdict through the parliamentary route under pressure from the Muslim orthodoxy. The apex court had ruled that Shah Bano, a divorced woman, was entitled to alimony from her husband, setting aside the husband’s plea that as per the Muslim personal law, maintenance in the case was applicable only for the Iddat period. But under pressure the Rajiv government reversed it by passing the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce) Act, 1986. This led to his regime being accused of “minority appeasement” by the BJP and other opponents of the Congress.\nSonia Gandhi\nUnlike her late husband Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi could not become the PM, but she became the longest serving president of the Congress for over two decades since 1998. She had a strong grip over the government when the Congress-led UPA came to power in 2004 after six years of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA governments.\nSonia had been a Lok Sabha MP since 1999 (first from Amethi and later from Raebareli),and while she did not join the Manmohan Singh Cabinet in the UPA government, some landmark policies like MNREGA and RTI were pushed by her in her role as the National Advisory Council chairperson. The MNREGA law guaranteed 100 days of employment to at least one member of every rural household in a financial year. The Right to Information Act mandated public authorities to provide information sought by an individual within 30 days of the application. Under the RTI law, a person could also file an application with the appellate authority if dissatisfied with the RTI reply.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSonia delivered a rare parliamentary speech in 2013 when she pitched for the National Food Security Bill, calling upon members to set aside ideological differences to support the measure that would feed millions\nof underprivileged people. Not the one to speak much in Parliament but always in command of the Congress and its policies, Sonia entered the Rajya Sabha early this year after being elected from Rajasthan unopposed.\nRahul Gandhi\nSonia’s son Rahul Gandhi first became the Lok Sabha MP from Amethi in 2004. In 2008, his speech in the House in which he mentioned his meeting with Kalawati, the widow of a farmer in Yavatmal who had committed suicide, made waves, drawing barbs from the BJP. Over the years, Rahul gave many speeches, often championing the cause of the poor and farmers.\nDuring a speech in the Lok Sabha in 2018, Rahul alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could not look him in the eye and that the BJP members hated him but he had no hatred towards them. He claimed that the Congress was about love with which it built the country and that he would bring it out even from the Treasury benches. After his speech, in an awkward gesture, he walked up to PM Modi and hugged him.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn recent years, Rahul’s speeches have become increasingly aggressive. He has repeatedly named two industrialists, alleging that the government makes policies for them. Just before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Rahul began to pitch for a national caste census, repeatedly saying that institutions had been unfair to the SCs, STs and OBCs.\nAfter the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, which saw the Congress emerging as the single largest Opposition party, Rahul became the LoP in the Lok Sabha. In his maiden speech as the LoP, he told the House that Hinduism is about love. He then pointed towards the Treasury benches and alleged that they are all about hate, which led to a blowback from the BJP members.\nManeka Gandhi\nManeka Gandhi, the widow of Sanjay Gandhi, quit the Congress to join the Janata Dal in 1989, and the BJP in 2004. She had been an MP for multiple times from various constituencies in UP. She was a Union minister in the Vajpayee Cabinet as well as in the previous Modi government. As a minister, she brought legislation like the Juvenile Justice Bill and the anti-human trafficking Bill, among others.\nVarun Gandhi\nManeka’s son Varun Gandhi was elected as a BJP MP from UP’s Pilibhit in 2009, from where he won for consecutive three terms until 2024. As an MP, he made news by supporting the Jan Lokpal Bill proposed by the movement led by social activist Anna Hazare. He introduced a private member’s Bill, Representation of People (Amendment) Bill, 2016, to give voters the right to recall their legislator. The Bill proposed that any voter could file a petition to the Speaker signed by at least 25% of the voters of the constituency for the MP to be recalled.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn August 2017, Varun said in the Lok Sabha during Zero Hour that MPs should not hike their salaries and that this should be done by an external statutory body."

        "content": "Mumbai police have registered a sexual harassment case against actor Sharad Kapoor on the complaint of a 32-year-old actress and producer from Goregaon. Kapoor, who is best known for his work in films like Josh, Lakshya and Dastak, has denied the allegations.\nThe Khar police confirmed that they registered a case against the actor on Wednesday night and are investigating the matter.\nAccording to officers, the complainant has a production house and she also makes reels and uploads videos on social media platforms. For the past three months, she has been getting messages from a Facebook user who claimed to be actor Sharad Kapoor.\nADVERTISEMENT\nShe initially ignored him, but after receiving several messages, the woman told him to make a video call so she could verify his identity.\nAccording to the FIR, on November 26, she received a video call from Kapoor who told her that he saw her profile on Facebook and Instagram, and wished to do some work with her. He allegedly requested her to visit his office to discuss shooting-related work. They also exchanged mobile numbers.\nThe actor shared his address with her along with the Google location. The same evening, the woman reached the address and found that it was Kapoor’s home and not his office.\nThe complaint said an elderly housekeeper opened the door. When the woman entered, the actor called her from his bedroom and asked her to go straight to his room.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“When I reached his bedroom door, I saw he was completely naked. I stepped back and asked him to wear clothes. I told him that I was not comfortable talking with him as he was undressed. But he insisted that I go inside and said, ‘Please come and hug me and kiss me’. I refused,” the complainant said in her statement to Khar police. She added that he then “hugged” and “groped” her, prompting her to run away.\nLater in the evening, Kapoor allegedly sent her a photo and a link to obscene material over WhatsApp. He also sent her a voice note claiming that it was his girlfriend’s photo. He further abused the complainant using vulgar language in the voice note, states the FIR.\nThe woman soon approached the Khar police and filed a complaint. The police booked the actor under sections 74 (assault or use of criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 75 (sexual harassment), and 79 (word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS).\n“No arrest has been made yet as the offence attracts a punishment of less than seven years, a criteria for arrest as per the Supreme Court’s guidelines. We have sent a notice asking him to be present before the police for questioning,” an officer said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen contacted, Kapoor said the allegations against him are false and baseless. “I am in New York. I was not in the country at the time of the alleged incident. I have never done such a wrong thing and never ever imagined doing so. I have met this woman once. The complaint against me is false,” he said, adding that his representative will soon respond to the police notice."

        "content": "Recently, AR Rahman and Saira Banu announced their separation after 29 years of marriage. Vandana Shah, who claimed to be representing them in the proceedings, appeared for several interviews to talk about the separation. More recently, she spoke to actor R Madhavan about the points that married couples should consider in the eventuality of a divorce. During the conversation, Madhavan said that his wife Sarita was insecure when he first started out as an actor. But certain financial decisions brought stability to their relationship, and they have been happily married for 25 years.\nDiscussing finances on the YouTube channel For A Change, Madhavan said, “I was an actor. I was starting off and was being hailed as the chocolate boy, and girls were fond of me. Obviously, this would create an insecurity for the woman. And having this insecurity is good enough for a marriage to become unstable. I used to ask my parents what they did, and they said, ‘We decided to spend our lives together so why assume that things are going to go wrong? We are going to say things are going to go right’. They always had a joint account for everything. I said, ‘That makes a lot of sense’.”\nHe added, “If Sarita is going to feel insecure every time she looks at her bank account. It is better that we look at it together and say, ‘This is a joint account, this belongs to both of us and you are an equal signatory on it.’ So, I am going to assume that this marriage is going to work and I am going to say that I trust you and I hope you trust me.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMadhavan shared this approach to finances “worked” for the couple quiet well. He said, “There was never a doubt about how much I am earning. She handles the whole economics. In fact, all the cars and properties we have bought so far… we are joint owners.”\nThe actor quipped, “I am one of the guys who lives off his credit card so all the money is with my wife.”\nALSO READ | Tarachand Barjatya made Zarina Wahab quit non-veg food to play Radha in Gopal Krishna: ‘It was difficult at first’\nBefore becoming an actor, R Madhavan was a communication and public speaking coach.

In an interview with Times of India, the actor recalled that Sarita asked him out for a thank you dinner after she landed her first job.

        "content": "Even as the Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution on Friday expressing confidence in the party president to complete a review and take follow-up action on organisational matters, the Maharashtra unit is set to witness fireworks as differences have already started spilling out.\nBunty Shelke, party candidate from Nagpur Central, alleged that state unit chief Nana Patole was an ‘RSS agent’. “I was given the ticket but no office bearer was with me while campaigning. Even when Priyanka Gandhi came to Nagpur for a roadshow, nobody from the party turned up. I remained firm on my earlier statement that Patole works for RSS,” he said.\nShelke’s allegation comes after the party’s review meeting with defeated candidates. According to sources within the party, the Maharashtra leadership of the Congress is busy pointing out alleged discrepancies in the voters’ data and turnout post the Assembly election debacle but is silent about the organisational failure of the party in the state.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Saturday, Maharashtra Congress issued a show cause notice to Shelke, asking him to reply within two days. “Your actions are violating the party discipline and you should reply within two days as to why you shouldn’t be suspended from the party…failing to reply would be considered as you do not have any statement to make and you will be suspended,” the notice issued by state Congress vice-president Nana Gawande.\nA Youth Congress leader pointed out that from the day of the results, the leadership has maintained the focus on malpractices of the Election Commission of India. “Nobody is denying that the entire process is suspicious. But how can we get away without realising our organisational failure as well? Will nobody take the responsibility?” the leader asked.\nThe resolution passed on Friday said, “The CWC also accepts that the party’s performance, as indeed that of its MVA allies, in Maharashtra has been inexplicable and is, in fact, shocking. The electoral outcome is beyond normal understanding. It appears to be a clear case of targeted manipulation. The CWC expresses its hope and confidence that the Congress president will complete the detailed state-wise reviews soon and take the necessary follow-up action, particularly in relation to organisational matters. These matters need urgent attention both at the AICC level as well in all states.”\nAnother senior party leader and former Maharashtra minister said that along with working on ECI’s malpractices, the party needs to focus on giving a leadership which will take everyone along and not work in an autocratic way. “The organisational overhaul is of utmost importance. We will be raising the issue in the meetings that will be held in the coming month,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAtul Londhe, the chief spokesperson of the Maharashtra Congress, said that the party works on directions given by the CWC. “The CWC has discussed all organisational matters as well and necessary steps would follow. We as an organisation fought the election unitedly. If someone has any other view, then that can be presented in the meeting and the leadership will take action accordingly,” said Londhe.\nThe Congress only managed to win 16 seats in the Assembly elections."

A session named ‘Asmaan Se Aaya Farishta – A Tribute to Mohd Rafi – The King of Melody’ was held in his memory where Sonu Nigam spoke about the versatility of Mohd Rafi and said that the late singer, who was a Muslim man, would undergo ‘dharam parivartan’ while singing bhajans.\nThe Sandese Aate Hai singer highlighted how Mohd Rafi was able to sing for every actor during his time. “This person is singing ‘Hum Kaale Hain Toh Kya Hua Dilwaale Hain’, and also singing ‘Sarr Jo Tera Chakraaye Ya Dil Dooba Jaaye’. His voice used to suit Dilip Kumar, Johnny Walker, Mehmood, as well as Rishi Kapoor,” he said.\nFurther elaborating on his versatile singing, Sonu mentioned, “When he sings bhajan, lagta hai koi pakka Hindu gaa raha hai. Hain vo musalmaan, namaazi aadmi hain. Inka dharam parivartan kaise hojaata hai gayaki mein? (It felt like a Hindu was singing by heart, despite being a muslim. How was he able to change his religion while singing?)”\nADVERTISEMENT\nALSO READ | When Lata Mangeshkar-Mohammad Rafi concert paved way for liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli\nHe further added, “This is a huge deal, not everyone can do it. I know so many singers who can sing Sufi songs really well, but cannot sing any bhajans. He would sing for Ramzan, Raksha Bandhan, he would sing happy songs, sad songs, even the most famous Happy Birthday song. There is nothing that he hasn’t done. Yeh kaun aadmi hai? (Who is this man?) He was a volcano, who would only used to erupt in the mic.”\nFor the unknown, Mohd Rafi is remembered for his popular songs like “Main Zindagi Ka Saath Nibhata Chala Gaya”, “Kaun Hai Jo Sapno Me Aaya”, “Parda Hai Parda”, “Gulabi Aankhein”, “Kya Se Kya Ho Gaya”, among others.\nMohd Rafi passed away in 1980 at age 55.\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

        "title": "How Brazil exposed the G20 crisis",
        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-brazil-exposed-the-g20-crisis-9698436/",
        "content": "As the fading graffiti on the streets of New Delhi archives the memory of India’s G20 presidency in 2023, the elite club concluded its 19th Leaders’ Summit on November 18-19 in Rio de Janeiro under Brazil’s leadership. The summit ended successfully with a joint declaration but left a bitter aftertaste. What was most surprising is that the “premier forum for international economic cooperation” continued to call itself G20 (19 countries and the European Union), and not G21, despite including the African Union as a permanent member last year. This act of not renaming the forum faced criticisms as it demonstrated the reluctance of the elite club to genuinely include Africa in global decision-making. However, the Brazilian presidency, under the theme “Building a just world and a sustainable planet”, raised some fundamental concerns and exposed some diplomatic cracks.\nFirstly, the summit was not attended by the heads of Russia and Saudi Arabia. While Vladimir Putin said that his presence would “wreck” the summit because of the ICC arrest warrant issued against his name, the last-minute cancellation by the Saudi Crown Prince generated speculations. More importantly, the final declaration was not entirely endorsed by Argentina because of President Javier Milei’s ideological opposition to the sustainable development agenda, welfare spending, and regulation of hate speech on social media. Further, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, questioned the G20’s effectiveness in managing the current global crises and warned of possible trade wars as Donald Trump reenters the White House. Other Western powers such as Germany, the UK and Canada also criticised the communique for its weak language on the Ukraine war. On the other hand, the G20 affirmed Palestine’s right to self-determination and advocated for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. Looking at this shaky consensus on geopolitics, one cannot help but ask if the G20 is on the verge of an implosion.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSecondly, the prime outcome of the summit was the launch of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty (GAAHP), supported by 148 signatories, which includes 82 countries, international organisations, financial institutions and philanthropic bodies. It is going to be an independent platform, open to broader membership. It aims to lift 500 million people globally out of hunger and poverty by 2030 through initiatives like cash transfers, school meals, improved access to microfinance, access to water, and similar targeted interventions for social protection. While the launch of this alliance is a welcome decision, NGOs like Oxfam have pointed out that transparency in governance, clear safeguards vis-a-vis private-sector control over policy-making and inclusion of voices of civil society are crucial for its success. How the GAAHP initiative unfolds remains to be seen.\nThirdly, the G20 declaration did not mince words. It acknowledged that “inequality within and among countries is at the root of most global challenges that we face.” It committed to addressing inequalities and called for “social, economic and political inclusion and empowerment of all” to achieve ethnic and racial equality. A crucial step in this direction is the endorsement of progressive taxation and cooperative engagement to effectively tax “ultra-high-net-worth individuals.” While the US, Germany and Argentina opposed the wealth tax proposal, anti-poverty activists globally lauded the move as “a historic decision” for responding to “people’s demands worldwide to tackle extreme inequality, hunger and climate breakdown.”\nFourthly, the call to bring “transformative reform” in the UNSC to ensure greater representation, particularly of countries from Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, is noteworthy. In addition, the group also reiterated its earlier commitments to reform the international financial architecture and institutions like the World Bank, Multilateral Development Banks and WTO. Reform of the global governance institutions to ensure substantive representation has been a long-standing demand. Observers have persistently pointed out how conditionalities imposed by Bretton Woods institutions like the IMF have resulted in “social, environmental and economic catastrophes” in countries of the Global South.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFinally, the G20 leaders also pledged to increase climate finance from billions to trillions, without presenting a clear roadmap. They hoped that this commitment would boost the CoP29 negotiations in Baku and culminate into a successful New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance. However, the outcome of CoP29 turned out to be an “optical illusion” as rich countries agreed to contribute only $300 billion by 2035 to help poor countries deal with the impact of climate change. On the related question of dealing with the debt crisis of low- and middle-income countries, the G20 reaffirmed faith in its existing Common Framework which, as the case of Zambia revealed, is a flawed one and furthers economic instability.\nMOST READ\n1\nDear Jaguar, now that you have picked the ‘inclusive’ lane, stick to it\n2\nThe JEE system is broken. Here’s how India can produce employable engineers\n3\nDushyant Dave writes: When the courts act in their own contempt\n4\n‘Constitutionalism’ has become another word for extending colonial legacies\n5\nRam Madhav writes: Why the BJP keeps winning elections\nAs a contender for the voice of the Global South, Brazil has struck the right chord with the pressing concerns of the people and the planet. The launch of the GAAHP and the endorsement of taxing the rich are two crucial steps. Interestingly, while the Brazilian government hid its poor neighbourhoods or favelas behind colourful walls during the summit, it also held a Favelas20 to engage with voices from these marginal neighbourhoods. Unlike India, observers commended Brazil for engaging with civil society. However, the G20 in India was a diplomatic triumph as the chair could build a consensus, even though the final declaration was considered “compromised”, “uninspiring and underwhelming.”\nBrazil exposed the crisis of the G20. The return of the Trump administration will impact the forum’s existing commitments towards tackling climate, multilateralism and trade, among other issues. In turn, diplomatic disruptors like Argentine president Milei who endorsed cuts in government spending are likely to thrive. Moreover, the position of the US and Germany on the wealth tax, and the CoP29 negotiations reveal the West’s unwillingness to deal with people’s just demands. The situation is the same when it comes to debt justice. The challenge from a growing BRICS is also a serious concern for a divided G20 today. In a world of multiple intersecting crises — wars, hunger, widening inequalities, unprecedented forced migration, health emergencies, debt and climate crisis — it is perhaps time to rethink the relevance of informal clubs dictating global governance.\nThe writer is assistant professor of Political Science at GITAM University, Bengaluru"

        "content": "Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk traveled Saturday to his country’s border with the Russian region of Kaliningrad to inspect progress in the construction of military fortifications along the eastern frontier, calling it “an investment in peace.”\nTusk’s visit comes a month before Poland is to take over the rotating presidency of the 27-member European Union. Polish officials say their priority is to urge Europeans to beef up defenses at a time of Russian aggression and with change coming soon in Washington. Some European leaders are concerned that the incoming administration of Donald Trump might be less committed to Europe’s defense.\nTusk also proposed this week that Poland and the Nordic and Baltic countries carry out joint navy patrols in the strategically important Baltic Sea, following the suspected sabotage of undersea data cables. Poland’s government and army began building the system dubbed East Shield this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt will eventually include approximately 800 km along the Polish borders with Russia and Belarus, at a time when Western officials accuse Russia of waging hybrid attacks against the West that include sabotage, the weaponization of migration, disinformation and other hostile measures.\n“The better the Polish border is guarded, the more difficult it is to access for those with bad intentions,” Tusk said at a news conference near the village of Dabrowka as he stood in front of concrete anti-tank barriers.\nPoland has been at the mercy of aggressive neighbors over the past centuries and has become a leading European voice for security at a time when France and Germany are weakened by internal political problems.\nPoland aims to spend 4.7 per cent of its gross domestic product on defense next year, making it one of NATO’s leaders in defense spending. Tusk’s government estimates that the strategic military project will cost at least 10 billion zlotys ($2.5 billion).\nADVERTISEMENT\nPoland’s borders with Russia, Belarus — as well as Ukraine — are the easternmost external borders of both the European Union and NATO. Tusk said he expected the East Shield to eventually be expanded to protect the small Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n“Everything we are doing here — and we will also be doing this on the border with Belarus and Ukraine — is to deter and discourage a potential aggressor, which is why it is truly an investment in peace,” Tusk said.\n“We will spend billions of zlotys on this, but right now the whole of Europe is observing these investments and our actions with great satisfaction and will support them if necessary.”\nTusk did not elaborate on his plans for reinforcing the border with Ukraine, a close ally. Along the frontier, anti-tank barriers known as “hedgehogs” will be integrated with natural barriers like ditches.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTusk said parts of the project are not visible to the naked eye, but it is nonetheless the largest project of its nature in Europe since the end of World War II.\nThe plans also include the construction of threat reconnaissance and detection systems, forward bases, logistics hubs, warehouses and the deployment of anti-drone systems, the state news agency PAP reported."

The accused were identified through CCTV footage of the court premises, the scene of the violence on November 26.\nPolice said one person identified as Chandan Das was the primary accused as he was seen chopping the lawyer with a sharp weapon.\nThe incident sparked nationwide outrage with lawyers and political groups taking to the streets demanding stern punitive actions against Islam’s killers while some groups wanted ISKCON Bangladesh to be banned.\nADVERTISEMENT\nISKCON Bangladesh, however, said Das was expelled from the organisation long before his arrest and added that ISKCON was not involved in the murder or violence."

        "content": "When Priyanka Chopra started her career in the entertainment industry, she was just 18. Her mother, Dr Madhu Chopra, paused her own career as a doctor to be with her daughter. In a recent interview, Madhu recalled how her son Siddharth Chopra somehow became the “collateral damage” to Priyanka’s success. Madhu said that Siddharth was just a teenager when she had to leave to be with Priyanka. She said that her husband, Dr Ashok Chopra, was also occupied with work, which meant that Siddharth grew up without parental influence.\nTalking on Something Bigger Show’s YouTube channel, Madhu shared, “Siddharth was the collateral damage to all of Priyanka’s success, because dad was working, I was with Priyanka, he just grew up on his own and he was a teenager at that time. He, I think, was collateral damage for me.” Madhu got emotional as she spoke about Siddharth and shared, “When I think about it, these are certain things that you had to deal with him.”\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/donald-trump-picks-indian-american-kash-patel-as-new-fbi-director-9699664/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday announced that he has nominated Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nKash Patel, who has been an ally and former US defence department chief of staff in the first Trump administration, is an Indian-American and is widely known as a Trump loyalist.\nIn a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “I am proud to announce that Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel will serve as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nEarlier, Kash Patel’s name was doing rounds in the political corridors of the Washington to lead the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) but Trump chose his close ally John Ratcliffe to lead the CIA.\nAlongside Patel’s announcement, Trump also said that he has picked Chad Chronister, sheriff of Florida’s Hillsborough County, as head of the Drug Enforcement Agency.\nDetailing about Kash Patel’s work during his first tenure, President-elect Trump said “Kash did an incredible job during my First Term, where he served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Defense, Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council. Kash has also tried over 60 jury trials.”\nPatel is poised to replace Christopher Wray, who is the incumbent FBI director and was appointed by Trump in 2017 for a period of 10-year. Trump announced that Patel would be working under Attorney General Pam Bondi. Though Patel’s selection could only be confirmed after it is passed by the Republican-led Senate.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWho is Kash Patel?\nPatel, the son of Indian immigrants, is a former defence lawyer and federal prosecutor with a history of working parellel with Republican Trump. Patel gained prominence as a senior counsel to the House Intelligence Committee in 2017, where he played a key role in Republican-led probe.\nIn 2019, Patel was hired as a national security aide during Trump’s first tenure, later becoming Chief of Staff to the Defence Secretary in 2020. He has authored a memoir, Government Gangsters, and two pro-Trump children’s books, including The Plot Against the King, which features thinly-veiled portrayals of political figures such as Hillary Clinton.\nPatel is also a vocal critic of what he calls the “deep state” and has accused the press of being “the most powerful enemy the United States has ever seen.” He currently serves on the board of Trump Media and Technology Group, earning at least $120,000 annually from a consulting contract.\nPatel’s vision for the FBI\nPatel has often proposed sweeping changes to the FBI, including reducing its authority and removing senior leadership, which he has described as embodying “government tyranny.” He is expected to bring this reformist approach to the role if confirmed by the US Senate which is dominated by Republicans.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn an interview earlier this year on “The Shawn Ryan Show,” Patel vowed to sever the FBI’s intelligence-gathering activities from the rest of its mission and said he would “shut down” the bureau’s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state.’” “And I’d take the seven thousand employees that work in that building and send them across America to go chase down criminals,” he added.\nThe FBI issued a statement following the announcement, emphasising its ongoing work. “Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to protect Americans from a growing array of threats,” the agency said. “Director Wray’s focus remains on the people we serve and the mission we uphold.”\nA favourite of MAGA media\nPatel’s candidacy has won support from prominent Trump supporters, including people who support the president-elect’s agenda at the FBI and Justice Department and the idea of using his electoral win to pursue retaliation against his perceived adversaries.\nHe’s been a regular guest on right-wing podcasts and live-stream online shows hosted by Steve Bannon, Tim Pool, Benny Johnson among others.\n(with inputs from Associated Press)\n🗳️ Click here for the latest news and updates from the US Presidential Elections 2024"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/maharashtra-bjp-chief-minister-ajit-pawar-9699214/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "Ending speculation on the swearing in of a BJP-led government in Maharashtra, the party’s state unit Saturday said the oath-taking would be held on December 5 in Mumbai in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Separately, Ajit Pawar, the chief of Nationalist Congress Party, one of the two key allies of BJP, confirmed that the Chief Minister would be from the BJP, and the state government would have two Deputy CMs, one each from the two allies, NCP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena.\nTagging the party’s Chief Ministerial candidate Devendra Fadnavis, Shinde and Pawar, the state BJP President, Chandrashekhar Bawankule, said on social media that the ceremony on December 5 would be held at 5 pm in Mumbai’s Azad Maidan.\nWhat has somewhat delayed government formation in the state despite a clear mandate to the Mahayuti is caretaker Chief Minister Shinde’s decision to go to his village Dare in Satara district the very day he returned from New Delhi after the meeting of all allies. Some in his party said this indicated Shinde’s “unhappiness” and that he was keen that the Home Ministry portfolio in the new government be allocated to Shiv Sena.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBack home in his village, Shinde is learnt to have taken ill. His family doctor RM Parte told the media in Satara that Shinde has throat infection and fever, that he was under treatment, and should get better in two-three days.\nBJP tried to downplay any rift with its ally. Bawankule said everything will be finalised over the next 2-3 days and the CM along with his deputies would be sworn in together on December 5. Sources in the BJP said the central observers would travel to Mumbai over the next couple of days and oversee the appointment of the new leader during a legislative party meeting.\nBawankule held a meeting with the BJP district chief to plan the oath-taking ceremony on a grand scale in the presence of Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and CMs of other BJP-ruled states.\n“There is neither any delay in government formation, nor is there any dispute among alliance partners. The NDA has the credibility of taking along its alliance partners and ensuring proper coordination,” Bawankule told The Sunday Express. “All decisions related to Mahayuti and government formation will be taken by BJP central leaders and the parliamentary board in consultation with state leaders including the allies Shiv Sena and NCP,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn Pune, Ajit Pawar said the BJP had 132 MLAs and support of five independent and other MLAs. “This means 137 MLAs, and that is not a small number. We have already told the BJP that they can decide the CM and that will be accepted by us. A decision has been made that there will be a CM from the BJP and Dy CMs from the remaining two parties,” he told reporters.\nBJP sources said the legislative party meeting is likely to be held on December 2-3. Some Shiv Sena leaders The Sunday Express spoke with said Shinde is likely to participate in the Mahayuti meeting only after the BJP legislature party chooses its leader.\nOn Sena’s demands, some leaders in the party cited the portfolio allocation under Shinde wherein he agreed to let Fadnavis keep the home portfolio despite he being the Deputy CM. “When Shinde ji was CM, the home ministry was given to the Deputy CM. So, portfolio distribution should be done similarly; that would be fair. A leader like Shinde can maintain law and order very well even when sensitive situations of communal riots arise in the state,” said Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsat. Two other Sena MLAs Shambhuraj Desai and Bharat Gogawale seconded this argument.\nResponding to a question, Ajit Pawar of NCP said he had no idea whether the home portfolio will be given to Shinde or not. “The head of the state government will decide,” he said, adding, Shinde was not upset and he went to his village to rest. Sena sources said that Shinde had informed the leaders of BJP and NCP about his visit in advance. “He said he would be back to continue the talks on Sunday,” a Sena source said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBesides the home portfolio, the Shinde group has also demanded portfolios the party held in the outgoing government including Urban Development, Industry, Education, Health and Excise. “We do not want to make any compromises on it,” said the source.\nEXPLAINED\nVoter turnout data: why the big difference\nParty leaders denied reports Shinde had expressed his unwillingness to accept Fadnavis as the Chief Minister and cited Shinde’s statement during his press conference in Thane on Wednesday when he clearly said that whatever is the decision of PM and HM and whoever their CM candidate, Sena will fully support him.\nThe BJP leadership has also offered Shinde to come to the Centre and be part of the Narendra Modi government in case he is not keen on the Deputy CM’s post. “It’s a suggestion under consideration. But the question is how can you not accept a popular leader’s demand,” said a Sena leader.\nA senior BJP leader categorically ruled out any other candidate other than Fadnavis for the CM’s post. “Such experiments to handpick fresh faces is possible where BJP has absolute majority on its own, for instance, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Maharashtra is a complex state with a three-party coalition and strong regional leaders. In such a scenario, BJP has to appoint a strong leader with administrative capabilities and a good understanding of the state.”\n(WITH INPUTS FROM MANOJ MORE IN PUNE)\nClick here to join Express Pune WhatsApp channel and get a curated list of our stories"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/goodbye-cap-and-gown-welcome-kurta-and-sari-9699467/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "The traditional convocation dress, of satin robes and gowns, hoods and mortarboards (caps), will soon be a thing of the past.\nA review by The Indian Express of the 92 Central institutions — IITs, IIMs and Central universities under the Education Ministry — shows that since 2015, when the University Grants Commission (UGC) issued an advisory suggesting a change to “handloom fabric,” over 76% or three-fourths of the institutions have shed the colonial-era dress code.\nAs many as 70 have discarded ceremonial robes, with 62 having made the switch since 2015. Among the 23 IITs, all but IIT-Delhi have embraced Indian attire. Of these, 18 IITs made the change post-2015. These include six second- and third-generation IITs, where the first batch of students graduated after 2015 and their convocation attire was Indian.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen it comes to IIMs, while 14 of 21 have dropped the colonial dress code, not all have replaced it with Indian outfits. Of the 14 IIMs, students at seven wear Western formals with a stole, while the remaining have adopted Indian attire. However, IIM-Bangalore, IIM-Calcutta, IIM-Lucknow, IIM-Indore, IIM-Rohtak, IIM-Udaipur and IIM-Amritsar continue to follow the colonial convocation dress code.\nAmong Central universities funded by MoE, 34 of 48 have phased out robes and caps.\nAccording to the UGC advisory, in tune with the Prime Minister’s emphasis on “revival of handloom and improving earnings of the handloom weavers,”  universities were requested to consider using “handloom fabric for ceremonial dresses…for special occasions like convocation etc.”\nThis would not only “give a sense of pride of being Indian but also be more comfortable in the hot and humid weather,” the advisory said.\nAlso Read | IITs eye better placements this season with more companies, offers\nThe UGC advisory was followed by a call from then Education Minister Prakash Javadekar, who urged universities to replace the “British-inspired” attire as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdditional advisories from the UGC in 2019 and in January 2024, too, emphasised switching over to Indian attire, and promoting handloom as “comfortable for local weather” and a source of “pride in Indian heritage”.\nFollowing Ministry of Education’s lead, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recently asked medical institutes to adopt an Indian dress code for their convocation ceremonies.\nAmong Central universities funded by MoE, 34 of 48 have phased out robes and caps. Though 30 of 34 made this switch after 2015, the dress code at four institutions was already Indian attire or robes with traditional patterns: Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya in Maharashtra’s Wardha; Visva Bharati in West Bengal’s Santiniketan; Tezpur University in Assam; and Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri National Sanskrit University in New Delhi.\nOf the 34 Central universities where the convocation dress code does not mandate wearing of ceremonial robes anymore, four of them — University of Delhi, Central University of Jharkhand, Central University of Kerala and Central University of Tamil Nadu — have adopted a blend of Western and Indian elements for their graduation ceremony outfits.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAmong Central universities, BHU in Varanasi was among the first to respond to the government’s 2015 advisory. It transitioned from black robes to white kurtas-pyjamas for men and saris for women, along with a yellow uttariya and safas.\n“It was our 100th anniversary, and the management wanted to promote Indian culture,” says Dr Rajesh Singh, the BHU PRO.\nOf 11 Central universities that are yet to make this shift, five —including Rajiv Gandhi University in Arunachal Pradesh, North Eastern Hill University in Meghalaya, Nagaland University and Manipur University — confirmed that they were considering making a change.\n“While we haven’t finalised the specifics, we are definitely looking at more Indianised attire,” says Professor W. Chandbabu Singh, Registrar, Manipur University.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNagaland University, meanwhile, is having discussions on introducing the traditional Naga attire for the convocation ceremony.\nThree more of these universities — Sindhu Central University in Ladakh, Central University of Odisha and Central University of Andhra Pradesh — are relatively new and haven’t yet held a convocation ceremony.\nThe transition, however, has not been without challenges. An official from a Central university says, “The entire concept of a convocation is Western, so why insist on an Indian dress code at all?”\nAlso Read | ‘Design Indian dress codes’: Health Ministry asks institutes to ditch black robes for convocation\nIn November last year, IIT-Kharagpur’s detailed convocation dress code had triggered a controversy. The institute’s guidelines had specified the attire style, sleeve length, and even footwear and jewellery. Students, who already wore Indian-style clothing, called the guidelines restrictive. The institute later clarified that these details were not mandatory.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 2021, IIT-Jammu had faced criticism after it announced plans for convocation attire inspired by Kashmiri culture — pherans (knee-length robe) and pakols (soft, flat, rolled-up men’s cap). Following objections, it switched to white kurtas-pyjamas.\nOpposing the dress code introduced in 2015, Lucknow-based Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s Dalit Students Union had in 2019 requested permission to wear formal Western attire as a tribute to Dr B R Ambedkar.\nWhen it comes to IITs, even before the UGC advisory, IIT-BHU, IIT-Jodhpur, IIT-Bombay, IIT-Gandhinagar and IIT-Guwahati, had already changed it to Indian attire.\n“Since the beginning, our convocation dress code included cream kurtas-pyjamas, with an option for saris, paired with a dark cream Gandhi (Nehru) jacket. The intent was to reflect Indian culture,” says Professor Vikas Dubey, Dean, Research and Development, IIT-BHU.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIIT-Bombay, which always followed an Indian dress code, introduced a khadi uttariya (stole) in 2016.\nAt many graduation ceremonies now, the dress code includes a nod to the local regional culture. Instead of the traditional blue satin robe at IIT-Mandi for instance, graduates now wear off-white kurta-pyjamas and salwar-kurtas or saris paired with a Himachali shawl and topi (cap).\nAt Banaras Hindu University (BHU), students now don kurta-pyjamas and saris along with a traditional safa (turban) and uttariya, while IIM-Shillong’s convocation attire features a Khasi wrap.\nIncidentally, in 2010, Jairam Ramesh, former environment minister and a Congress member, had removed his convocation robe in protest, calling them a “barbaric colonial relic,” at a ceremony organised by the Indian Institute of Forest Management in Bhopal."

All it needs is to watch carefully the visuals that appear on your TV screens every time there is a new fight over a mosque, or a temple and you will see what I mean about bigger problems.\nFor some days now I have watched the violent clashes over the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal and the aftermath. Instead of gazing at the white mosque that looms over shabby bazaars and slums, I have been more interested in what lies below this mosque with so grandiose a name. And I have been horrified by the slimy drains that line dilapidated alleys, the decrepit stairways that rise from hovel-like shops and the general sense of decay that hangs over everything. Images from the destruction of Gaza came to mind and not for the first time it shamed me to see that living conditions that usually come because of war exist in India in normal, ordinary peaceful times.

        "content": "A district court on Saturday sentenced former Punjab Police Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Jagvir Singh to life imprisonment for kidnapping his son-in-law Gurdeep Singh 14 years ago. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the accused.\nThe court of Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Baljinder Singh Sra sentenced Jagvir Singh to life imprisonment under Section 364 (kidnapping) and a fine of Rs 10,000, seven years under Section 466 (forgery of documents and electronic records) and a fine of Rs 5,000, and five years each under Sections 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 474 (possessing a forged document or electronic record with intent to use it fraudulently) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). All sentences will run concurrently.\nOn July 4, 2010, in the Phase XI area, the accused abducted Gurdeep Singh, his son-in-law, with the intention that he might be murdered or disposed of in a manner that endangered his life. Since then, Gurdeep has been untraceable.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the time of Gurdeep Singh’s disappearance, Jagvir Singh was posted as the Station House Officer (SHO) at Julkan police station in Patiala.\nInitially, a case was registered against Jagvir Singh under Sections 364 (kidnapping) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. Later, the charges were amended to include Sections 465 (forgery), 466 (forgery of documents and electronic records), 468 (forgery of valuable security), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), and 474 (possessing a forged document or electronic record with intent to use it as genuine).\nThe police challan revealed that during his tenure at Julkan police station, Jagvir Singh forged and inserted false entries in the Daily Diary Report (DDR) to create fabricated evidence and save himself from legal punishment. These insertions were proven to be forged by a report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh.\nThe case was registered based on a complaint filed by Bhupinder Kaur. She was represented by senior advocate A S Sukhija and advocate Shebaz Singh."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-dgp-interview-heroin-synthetic-drugs-9699805/",
        "content": "Punjab Director General of Police Gaurav Yadav tells Man Aman Singh Chhina that the availability of drugs like heroin on the streets and villages of Punjab has gone down drastically but the state has to battle international drug trafficking as well as drugs in transit from other states.\nExcerpts:\nGoing by the sheer volume of drugs seized and number of arrests made, it seems there is no let up in drugs trade year after year. How do you read that?\nWe have made a lot of progress. The street availability of drugs has come down drastically. If you see in the past three-four months there has been hardly any death due to drug overdose. No drugs are grown in Punjab but being a transit state, (Punjab shares border with Pakistan and other states) drugs are pumped into the state. Drugs come in from Pakistan through drones or via riverine routes. Drugs such as opium, poppy husk is also coming in from Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. In fact we have recovered lot of opium from Jharkhand and it has emerged as a source for the drug. Ganja comes from Himachal Pradesh. Heroin from here which is smuggled in from across the international border goes to Delhi and from there it is again re-packaged and sent back to Punjab. All these drugs come into the state and if you see our seizures and the number of arrests, its huge considering the size of Punjab. Every year we register around 12,000 FIRs under the NDPS Act and arrest around 13,000 to 14,000 accused while in the entire country there are 16,000 FIRs. So if you see the herculean efforts being made by Punjab, which is just 2 per cent of the size of India, it is a massive enforcement act.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSo the bulk of drugs are still coming from Pakistan?\nYes. This year we have also noticed a new trend. The Taliban in Afghanistan appear to have cracked down on opium production in the country. So there has been a fall in cultivation of poppy and production of opium there. In the recent seizures we have seen that smugglers are shifting to synthetic drugs like methamphetamine. Now these are coming in through drones in large numbers.\nGoing by the data of seizures, an abnormally high number of pills are being recovered in the state.\nThis is good detection. What is happening is that when we crackdown on heroin and the heroin availability decreases in the market, the consumer shifts to pharmaceutical drugs like ‘Signature capsule’. It was not banned anywhere. The SSPs are taking it up under relevant legal provisions with the Deputy Commissioners to seize these drugs. The diversion of these drugs for misuse is now being prevented. So we are conducting joint raids with other preventive agencies on pharmaceutical stores. Another thing which has worked is the forward and backward linkages. When you make a seizure we just don’t rest with the arrest of a person from whom it has been recovered but find out where it came from and where it was to be sent.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThere is a common perception that drugs cannot be sold in village and streets if the local police is not involved. How do you respond to this accusation?\nWe have zero tolerance for policemen who are conniving with drugs traders. We have arrested our police people when they are found involved and some have also dismissed them from service. There is a rotation policy of the government where we rotate our personnel after a fixed number of years, as is common in other civil departments too. The purpose is that no one should be able to develop a vested interest of linkages of any kind.\nWhen the police talk about ‘big fish’ who have been arrested for drugs trade, what do they mean? What is the profile of a ‘big fish’?\nMost of these ‘big fish’ I am talking about are the really, really big ones, with 300 kg, 500 kg heroin seizures. We classify ‘big fish’ with seizures of two kg heroin and above. There are many people who are middlemen who push drugs to retailers. They come from a variety of backgrounds. Some of them are hardcore criminals also. Most of the ‘pushers’ are addicts-turned-suppliers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIs it worthwhile to arrest small peddlers with miniscule quantities recovered? We have seen NDPS FIRs which mention seizure of only silver foil and matchsticks.\nWe are rather encouraging action in such cases under Section 64A of the NDPS Act. Our entire policy now, as against previous policies when jails were filled with small time peddlers, is that we do not want to arrest someone unnecessarily. Our basic principle is that we do not have to arrest the consumer. But the peddler has to be arrested and for minor seizures, under Section 64 A, there is legal provision that the charges are waived off if he volunteers to undergo de-addiction programme.\nThere has been lot of focus lately on Village Defence Committees (VDCs). What is their role?\nThese committees have been constituted with the orders of the respective DCs. And we work in perfect coordination with the civil counterparts. Generally the VDCs comprise 10 to 15 people, depending upon the size of the village. These are people from all walks of life and the nature of these committees is non-political and awareness is created against drugs trade in the area. There is a preference for ex-servicemen for being included in such committees.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAre you satisfied with the progress in the fight against drugs? What is the way ahead?\nWe are quite satisfied. The property forfeiture of smugglers has been a pathbreaking initiative with seizures worth Rs 284 crore cleared by the government. Smugglers cannot do any business dealing with their properties. It was a policy decision taken by the state government. The CM held a high-level review meeting and directed some measures and said this could be an effective way of dealing with the problem. We have also focused on technological upgradation in a big way. A slew of new measures is being taken so that the fight against drugs gets more teeth. At the ground level we are getting a feedback that there has been a definite decline in the drug trade and availability of drugs on the streets."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/consumer-commission-beer-food-poisoning-liquor-store-9699767/",
        "content": "The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh, has directed a local liquor store and its distributor to pay Rs 11,000 to a Panchkula resident for causing mental agony and harassment after he alleged food poisoning from beer purchased from the store.\nThe complainant, Vishal Singal, alleged that he purchased four small bottles of Hopper Witbier from The Liquor Estate in Manimajra, Chandigarh, on July 10, 2023, paying Rs 280 in cash. He purchased four more bottles the next day, paying Rs 280 via debit card.\nSingal claimed he experienced uneasiness, stomach aches, and vomiting on the night of July 11, 2023, which worsened, leading to symptoms of food poisoning. He alleged that the beer bottles sold to him were old, stale, and expired. Subsequent medical tests, including an ultrasound of the abdomen and blood tests, revealed inflammation of the liver and toxin concentration in the bile ducts, which he attributed to the beer.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn his complaint, Singal also highlighted that the beer bottles lacked critical details such as maximum retail price, import date, and importer or distributor contact information. He filed a legal notice against the liquor vend and its distributor before approaching the Commission.\nIn response, The Liquor Estate and Ozark Merchandising argued that Singal had not provided evidence proving that the beer was purchased from them. They contended that the receipt submitted did not specify the beer brand and claimed the allegations were baseless.\nDe Brabandere Brewery, Belgium, stated that the beer batch in question was manufactured in October 2021 and exported to India in November 2021. The brewery emphasised that the beer had a consumption expiry of January 6, 2023, and they could not be held liable for its sale after the expiry date.\nThe Chandigarh Excise and Taxation Department argued that Singal failed to submit an analysis report from a recognised food analyst to substantiate his claims.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Commission found that Singal’s medical reports did not conclusively prove that his health issues were caused by consuming the beer. However, it noted that Brindco Sales, another respondent, failed to contest the complaint and was proceeded against ex-parte.\nThe Commission directed The Liquor Estate, Ozark Merchandising, and Brindco Sales to jointly pay Rs 6,000 as compensation and Rs 5,000 as litigation costs to Singal. Complaints against other respondents were dismissed."

        "content": "The chemistry test done by this movie’s cast had to give off a lot of sparks: the romance between two high-school lovers, the tense relationship of a mother and daughter, the cocktail of authority and academia that waters ambition but drowns desire. Girls will be Girls, the debut directorial by Shuchi Talati that recently screened at the Dharamshala International Film Festival, is helmed by Preeti Panigrahi (23) in her first feature film performance. She had experience in college theatre and ad films before, but nothing prepared her for the scale of this project, which she scored with a screen test of acting like someone close to her own self: Mira, a straight-A student and high-school prefect who hasn’t experienced sex.\n“(I think the easiest part of the role was) the vulnerability it required,” says Panigrahi. “A massive amount of credit goes to how Shuchi wrote the entire thing. It’s supposed to be an awkward and vulnerable space for a teenager, and it was an absolute joy to embody that. I changed a lot of lines in the script related to Mira’s body, for my own. I told Shuchi that I feel like I have to look good, that everything about me should be okay before I get on-screen. She said that I don’t have to put myself through (the pressure) of looking perfect. She said, I like you just the way you are and I didn’t pick you for Mira just because of how you look — you embody other things about her that are more important to me. After that, a lot of my inhibitions were dodged off.”\nSubscribe to read on\nSelect your plan\nBEST VALUE\nAll-Access\nAd-lite experience\nAccess to premium stories\nAccess to ePaper\nSubscribe for ₹3.5/day\nDigital Only\nAd-lite experience\nAccess to premium stories\nAccess to ePaper\nSubscribe for ₹2.5/day\nAlready a subscriber?

        "content": "England’s 21-year-old batter Jacob Bethell played at number three for the first time in his first-class career on Test debut against New Zealand in Christchurch this week.\nBethell was lauded his performance in the first innings, where he faced 34 balls against a challenging new ball spell, then cashed in when the game was virtually over in the second during a manic 104-run chase in 12.2 overs. Before pulling for six in what would end up being the game’s final over, the left-hander smashed eight fours, including four in five balls off fellow debutant, Kiwi rookie Nathan Smith. Bethell closed the chase as reached fifty off just 37 balls, making it the second-quickest fifty on Test debut.\nJacob Bethell is a promising young cricketer, who was born in the Caribbean island of Barbados. He has lately received recognition for his international cricket performances, having made his T20I debut for England against Australia on September 11, 2024. Bethell is an all-rounder renowned for his aggressive hitting style and left-arm orthodox spin bowling. In T20 cricket, he has a strike rate of 137.57. Meanwhile, Jacob Bethell was also picked for Rs. 2.60 crore by Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the IPL 2025 Mega Auction last week.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEarlier this month, Bethell also became the youngest Englishman to score a T20I fifty, scoring a half-century at the age of 21 years and 17 days against West Indies in Barbados, his birthplace.\nVeteran Tim Southee, who is also one of the players caught in Bethell’s onslaught in the final stretch of his Test career, is incidentally the only player in Test history to reach a half-century on debut faster than the Englishman.\nThe argument around England’s choice to bat Bethell at No. 3 despite his lack of experience in the position and his inability to reach a first-class hundred was largely resolved by his knock. Nevertheless, Bethell has proven that he can handle the red ball just as effectively after making an impression in white-ball cricket for England in recent months."

Though Jammu and Kashmir produces electricity, it is given free of cost to some states and we have nothing for ourselves.

This has also been reflected in the deliberations of the Joint Committee of Parliament, which has been examining the Bill.\nLast Thursday, the Lok Sabha passed a motion to extend the tenure of this Joint Committee till the last day of the Budget session next year. The motion was moved by the panel chairperson and BJP MP, Jagdambika Pal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe YSRCP had been silent on the Bill earlier. In the recent Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the TDP, along with allies BJP and the Pawan Kalyan-led JanaSena Party (JSP), ousted the YSRCP from power in Andhra Pradesh, reducing it to just 11 Assembly and four Lok Sabha seats. The NDA constituents bagged the remaining 175 Assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats.\nNow, a weakened YSRCP seems to be reaching out to the Muslim community by opposing the contentious Waqf Bill. The community accounts for 9.56% of the state population as per the 2011 Census.\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, YSRCP Lok Sabha MP P V Mithun Reddy said, “The Waqf Bill is being brought in without taking Muslims into confidence.” The YSRCP maintains that Waqf land belongs to the community and “cannot be forcefully taken away”, he said.\nAlso read | As a new Gandhi enters the House, a look at Nehru-Gandhis’ Parliamentary journey\nWhile calling it a “one-sided” Bill, the YSRCP MP said, “Muslim community leaders have submitted their side of the argument against the proposed amendments. They have not given their consent to amend the Waqf Bill.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the parliamentary panel, which was formed to look into the amendments and concerns around them, the YSRCP’s Vijaysai Reddy, a member of the panel, had raised objections, Mithun Reddy said. “We will oppose the Bill in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. We stand with the minority community on this,” he added.\nHowever, the YSRCP had not opposed the Bill when it was brought in Parliament after the Lok Sabha polls. At the time the Opposition INDIA bloc had opposed the Bill in both Houses. “We are not with INDIA, so we did not oppose the Bill at the time. Now, after going through the Bill in detail, we realise that it is not in the best interest of the minority community,” said a YSRCP leader. The party has 11 MPs in the Rajya Sabha.\nExplaining the YSRCP’s new position on the Bill, a party leader said it is looking to consolidate its base among the Christian and Muslim minorities to its advantage. “When the TDP is openly taking a communal stand, it is in our interest to consolidate the minority vote,” the leader alleged.\nRecently, during the Tirupati laddu controversy, the TDP brought up Jagan Mohan Reddy’s Christian background, and Pawan Kalyan projected himself as a defender of Sanatan Dharma.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“As the Congress stands decimated in Andhra Pradesh after the bifurcation of the state in 2014, the YSRCP has been the party in which minorities have reposed their faith,” a YSRCP source said. After its Assembly poll rout, the YSRCP is now clutching at every vote it can get, the source said.\nEXPLAINED\nTDP’s silence & strategy\nTHE EXTENSION granted to the House panel examining the Waqf (Amendment) Bill has come as a breather to the TDP amid pleas from Muslim organisations to pay heed to the sentiments of the community on the issue. The TDP, a key ally of the BJP at the Centre, may not have openly opposed the Bill, but its leaders insist referring it to the parliamentary panel for scrutiny was done on the party's “insistence”.\nThe YSRCP’s new stance has put the TDP on the back foot, especially since Muslim organisations have begun supporting Jagan Mohan Reddy for opposing the Bill. On Friday, a delegation from a Muslim body Jamaat-e-Islami Hind met Reddy to “appreciate the YSRCP’s stand on the Waqf Bill”.\nThe TDP appears to be in a bind now, even as its leadership has maintained that the party has always been secular. So far, the TDP leadership, including Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, has not issued a public statement on the Waqf Bill. In November, however, TDP leader Nawab Jan said the TDP will not pass “any Bill that harms Muslims”.\nWhile the TDP, which is a key ally of the BJP at the Centre, may not have openly opposed the Bill, its leaders told The Indian Express that referring the bill to a parliamentary panel for scrutiny was done on the “TDP’s insistence”. “We had asked for the Bill to be referred for examination by a Joint Committee and it was granted,” a TDP leader said."

        "content": "India and China will consider “other aspects” of their bilateral ties in a calibrated manner now that they have completed pulling back their troops from the last two face-off points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.\n“The conclusion of the disengagement phase now allows us to consider other aspects of our bilateral engagement in a calibrated manner,” he said, briefing the House on recent developments in the India-China border areas and their implications on overall bilateral relations.\n“Our ties have been abnormal since 2020 when peace and tranquillity in the border areas were disturbed as a result of Chinese actions,” he said, adding that “recent developments that reflect our continuous diplomatic engagement since then have set our ties in the direction of some improvement”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn October 21, India and China reached an agreement on disengagement at friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, and weeks later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting in Russia’s Kazan – five years after their last bilateral meeting.\n“The House is cognizant of the fact that China is in illegal occupation of 38,000 sq km of Indian territory in Aksai Chin as a result of the 1962 conflict and the events that preceded it,” Jaishankar said. Furthermore, Pakistan illegally ceded 5,180 sq km of Indian territory to China in 1963, which had been under its occupation since 1948, he said.\n“India and China have held talks for multiple decades to resolve the boundary issue. While there is LAC, it does not have a common understanding in some areas,” he noted, adding that India remains “committed to engaging with China through bilateral discussions to arrive at a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for a boundary settlement”.\nReferring to the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in June 2020, Jaishankar said that in the months thereafter, India was “addressing a situation that had not only seen fatalities for the first time in 45 years but also a turn of events serious enough for heavy weaponry to be deployed in close proximity to the LAC”.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“While a determined counter deployment of adequate capability was the government’s immediate response, there was also the imperative of a diplomatic effort to defuse these heightened tensions and restore peace and tranquillity,” Jaishankar added.\nStating that “disengagement from friction points has been fully achieved”, Jaishankar said, “The next priority will be to consider de-escalation, that would address the massing of troops along the LAC with associated accompaniments.”\nHe also said that the overall relationship with China was bound to be impacted adversely in the light of the 2020 clashes, and going forward, India has made clear that “the development of our ties were contingent on the principles of mutual sensitivity, mutual respect and mutual interests”.\n“Throughout this period, the Government has maintained that India-China relations cannot be normal in the absence of peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInforming the House about the agreement reached on October 21, 2024, regarding Depsang and Demchok, he said that the twin considerations of an unstable local situation and an impacted bilateral relationship were the drivers for these recent endeavours. “These two areas have been the focus of our discussions in both WMCC and SHMC with the Chinese side since September 2022, when the last disengagement agreement was concluded at the Hot Springs area,” he noted.\n“The disengagement has now been achieved in full in Eastern Ladakh through a step-by-step process, culminating in Depsang and Demchok. With the task of disengagement completed, it is now our expectation that discussions would commence in regard to the remaining issues that we had placed on the agenda,” he said.\nOn the future course of the ties, he said, “We are clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas is a pre-requisite for the development of our ties. In the coming days, we will be discussing both de-escalation as well as effective management of our activities in the border areas.”\nThe conclusion of the disengagement phase now allows us to consider other aspects of our bilateral engagement in a calibrated manner, keeping our national security interests first and foremost, he said."

        "content": "Senior Bharat Rashtra Samiti leader and former minister in the K Chandrashekar Rao government, T Harish Rao, was named in an FIR related to alleged phone tapping. Harish is also KCR’s nephew.\nG Chakradhar Goud, a real estate dealer from Siddipet who lives in Bachupally, Hyderabad, and who founded the Farmers First Foundation which provides support to families of farmers in distress, lodged a complaint at Panjagutta police station on December 1. Siddipet is Harish Rao’s home constituency.\nThe Panjagutta police are also investigating phone-tapping allegations against the state’s Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB), which allegedly tapped the phones of several people at the behest of the BRS when it was in power.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGoud alleged that his initiative of interacting with farmers and helping their families had led to political rivalry and acrimony with Harish Rao as Goud was getting a lot of support at the ground level. He alleged that he received death threats and that his phones were under surveillance after he found an alert on his iPhone.\n“The main objective of my foundation is to encourage organic farming by providing farmers with modern techniques and creating business opportunities through stalls. On September 25, 2022, I organised a programme at Konda Bhudevi Garden near the new bus stand, Siddipet, where I financially supported the families of 100 agricultural tenant farmers who had committed suicide. We provided Rs 1 lakh to each family, amounting to Rs 1 crore. On March 26, 2023, I distributed Rs 1 lakh each to 150 widows of farmers who had committed suicide. I did not invite any political leader to either of these events. This includes the then MLA and minister T Harish Rao. This led to Harish Rao holding a grudge against me as my charitable activities were gaining significant public attention and support, and I was becoming increasingly popular among poor families,” he alleged.\n“Harish Rao and others criminally conspired to harm me by falsely implicating me in fabricated cases, tarnishing my reputation and attempting to discourage me from continuing my charitable work,” Goud alleged.\nAnticipating a ticket to contest from Siddipet, Goud joined the BJP, but when he did not get the ticket, he quit and joined BSP. Officials at Panjagutta police station have registered a case against Harish Rao on charges of criminal conspiracy, extortion, criminal breach of trust, criminal intimidation, and under Section 66 of the IT Act.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOfficials at the police station, where the first phone tapping case was registered, had earlier arrested former Deputy SP D Praneeth Rao, former Additional Superintendents of Police N Bhujanga Rao and M Thirupatanna, and former DCP of Task Force P Radhakishan Rao. Former SIB chief, retired IPS officer T Prabhakar Rao, is accused number one in the case, which is still under investigation."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/karnataka-congress-siddaramaiah-9704028/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "Apart from the implementation of the Congress’s five poll guarantees, one of the political highlights of the nearly 30 months that the Congress has been in power in Karnataka was a 125-km protest march that the BJP organised in August seeking the resignation of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah over alleged irregularities in Muda (Mysore Urban Development Authority) land allotments to his wife.\nThe week-long march, from August 3 to August 10, forced the CM and his supporters to shelve their plans for a massive show of strength with a mega rally around August 12 to celebrate his 77th birthday.\nIn the language of politics, big shows of public support are considered the real barometer of a leader’s popularity, and according to Congress insiders, it was a big show of support that Siddaramaiah’s close associates organised in Davangere in August 2022 to celebrate his 75th birthday, and attended by Rahul Gandhi, that propelled Siddaramaiah into the CM’s seat last year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWith the issue of the alleged Muda scam and other corruption allegations against Siddaramaiah now receding into the background on account of court cases, and the Congress sweeping three seats in the Assembly bypolls held on November 13, the grand old party is now set to hold a fresh show of strength in Hassan in south Karnataka on December 5.\nThe show of strength was initially viewed as another attempt by Siddaramaiah’s supporters to project his continuing popularity and to keep him as CM for a full five-year tenure despite recent temporary setbacks.\nAn anonymous letter\nAn anonymous letter written to the Congress leadership on November 29 claimed that the Swabhimana Samavesha (Self-esteem Convention) was intended to showcase the CM’s popularity and not that of the Congress.\nThe Congress then in a deft move took ownership of the rally — for communities such as the backward classes, Dalits, minorities and supporters from dominant castes that have traditionally stood with it — to project it as a big party show.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe rally will be held four days before the start of a Winter Session of the state legislature where the BJP, despite its internal disunity, is expected to go all guns blazing to give the government a hard time on issues such as the alleged Muda scam, classification of land as Waqf properties, and maternal deaths at government hospitals.\n“A self-esteem conference has been organised in Hassan on December 5 under the auspices of the Congress and the Backward Classes Alliance. The KPCC president (D K Shivakumar) and state in-charge general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala have also been invited for the convention,” Siddaramaiah said last week after the anonymous letter began doing the rounds.\nClaims of ‘personal glorification’\nThe letter addressed to Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge, and circulated in the media, said Siddaramaiah should not be allowed to hold the Swabhimana Samavesha as an event for “personal glorification”.\nWhen the letter appeared in the public domain, Siddaramaiah denied knowledge of it as did D K Shivakumar, the deputy CM who aspires to hold the top job. “There is no information about an anonymous letter being written to the High Command regarding the convention,” Siddaramaiah said while pointing out that Kharge also did not mention it during meetings in Delhi on November 29.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This convention is being held under the leadership of KPCC. Friends and self-respecting unions that are supporting the party have also decided to stand in support of the work being done by the chief minister and the government, and I congratulate them for joining hands with us. We are holding this convention for the welfare of people,” Shivakumar said Monday.\nThe deputy CM also said similar conventions would be held across the state in the coming days to highlight the popularity of the government. “Our ministers and legislators are preparing for this convention. We have to give a message to the people through this convention. In politics, the relationship between the party and the people is very important. The Opposition parties do politics on emotions. We do politics for the lives of people,” he said.\nMessage is the medium\nShivakumar said the message of the convention would be that the Congress “has kept the faith of the people” even as “BJP and JD(S) leaders tried to destabilise this government”.\nThe rally is seen as a sign of the Congress gaining confidence on the back of its recent bypolls wins, something that may lead to the long-delayed local polls for town and zilla panchayats and city councils being held. Bengaluru, for instance, has not had a city council since September 2020.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The town panchayat and zilla panchayat elections will be held soon. We have discussed this in the Cabinet meeting. We are preparing for a February election,” Shivakumar said. Siddaramaiah, according to insiders, told the Congress high command that organising mass rallies and conventions would bolster the party’s efforts to contest the local polls.\nSiddaramaiah is widely seen as nearing the end of his political career, with his current term possibly his last as CM. The Congress does not have a similar pan-Karnataka leader from the backward classes and is now looking at using his popularity to cement its hold on its traditional vote base of minorities, backward classes and Dalits (AHINDA) even as the BJP and the JD(S), which enjoy the support of the dominant Lingayat and Vokkaliga communities, attempt to break the Congress hold over the backward classes and Dalits."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/woman-officer-leaked-letter-co-indian-army-9702669/",
        "content": "The leaked letter by a senior army officer that went viral recently, on the subject of “command by women officers”, shows that not only will women have to continue to fight for their right to equal opportunity at workplaces but that they will also be subjected to special scrutiny by those who might pass off personal judgment as “pragmatic performance analysis”.\nThe claims made in this letter do not indicate what research instruments were used, whether the sample size was valid, what the control sample was. There are other questions: Was the opinion of research subjects involved? Was a similar study done on men in CO positions at a similar length of their starting as COship? What were the metrics used to measure variables like lack of tact, empathy and mutual respect, holding of mistrust, overcompensating for softness, etc?\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe letter identifies a total of seven issues and seven causes for these issues. It also suggests six remedial measures. To look at these is interesting — and quite funny. If the letter had not been signed, it could easily have been mistaken for a list of complaints from a manager in a small corporation rather than a senior officer of the gallant Indian army.\nAny person irrespective of gender can err in a given assignment. It is precisely to guide them, in case of an error, that there are superiors and supervisory officers. There are other measures like counselling, annual appraisals, transfer recommendations and even departmental enquiry to monitor and evaluate the performance of COs.\nThe “issues” identified can at best be defined as gray. The language defining the seven issues is such that it seems that they are specific to women and that they are so insurmountable that nothing other than a complete overhaul of these positions would serve as a remedial measure. The writer of the letter states that women COs lack “empathy” and that there has been an increase in officer management issues over the last year. There is no mention of base data or percentage or a comparison to units led by men. Especially ludicrous is the comment that women leaders are either over-ambitious or lack ambition altogether. It’s not just women officers, sir — this could apply to any person with a job.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe causes of the perceived issues are equally ambiguous. The letter states that women officers were not trained to be COs, so they lack compassion, try to ensure a mean facade, etc. I believe the initial training of all cadres who join Indian Armed forces is all-round. Such comments are a slight to the academies that strive to train the men and women who join the prestigious services, and they are an affront to the faithful ustads who never differentiate between cadets while training them. It is hard to believe that all errors in management were done by one gender only and that experienced seniors cannot guide women COs to navigate any teething troubles. It also says women have “a desire to prove themselves”. A good boss would mould this desire to get the best output instead of complaining about it. The letter also states that women perceive a gender bias — I would argue that this letter itself is proof that the gender bias is not mere perception.\nMOST READ\n1\nWhy Bangladesh is not Pakistan\n2\nPratap Bhanu Mehta writes: Why the South Asian neighbourhood is on edge\n3\nGovernment of India has the wrong approach in Manipur. Here’s what it needs to do\n4\nYogendra Yadav writes: What kind of India do we seek?\n5\nHow to raise a boy: I didn’t want my son to be like his father…\nAmong the six remedial measures, the strangest one is that displaying the achievements of women in events such as “all-women bike rallies” should be avoided since they are already empowered. It also states that women celebrate minor achievements. If the mindset displayed in this letter finds concurrence among others, then no achievement by women could be considered minor.\nAnother remedial measure suggested is for spousal postings to be equated with postings on compassionate ground. This reeks of sexism — as if spousal postings are done as a favour only to women and have nothing to do with men.\nThe Indian Armed Forces are the bulwark of our country. There is no place for privilege or special treatment, and erring personnel must be re-trained or punished as per the department rules. However, there should be no room for loosely-based analysis of a handful of officers, some of whom may have been on the job for less than a year. Before anything changes, mindsets must.\nThe writer is an IPS officer. Views are personal"

        "content": "Professor Amiya Kumar Bagchi passed away on November 28 at 88. A legendary Indian academic, teacher and institution builder has left us. Since the 1970s, there would hardly be any historian or economist in any premier institution in India who was not exposed to or grappled with his writings, whether they agreed with some of his conclusions or not. He will be sorely missed, particularly in today’s times when the academic world is under severe stress in India, with free and non-conformist thought becoming increasingly difficult and even punishable.\nIf there was one quality that distinguished Professor Bagchi, it was his ability to stand up boldly against the dominant current, however powerful and pervasive it may be, if his own research and conviction pointed the other way. In the discipline of economics, India began to witness by the late 1960s and early ’70s a turn away from the study of Political Economy, (which was the hallmark of our early nationalists, people like Dadabhai Naoroji and R C Dutt, a tradition kept alive by later economists like Bhabatosh Datta, B N Ganguli, K N Raj and several others), towards econometrics, mathematical modelling, game theory, etc. It was at that time that Bagchi, as a doctoral student at Cambridge, switched from being a game theorist to probing issues of political economy, particularly economic history. Economic history proved critical in making major theoretical breakthroughs, as is evident from the writings of Karl Marx, Dadabhai Naoroji, Maurice Dobb, Ernest Mandel, Andre Gunder Frank, Paul Baran, Daniel Thorner and so many others. Bagchi too used his deep foray into economic history to make important theoretical generalisations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBagchi’s magnum opus Private Investment in India, 1900-1939, published in 1972 was his first major work as a result of his shift in focus to economic history. Based on research from a variety of sources in India and England, the book immediately became a must-read for every student of history and economics and it remains so till today, more than 50 years after it was published. After a deep and thorough study of all major sectors of the Indian economy, Bagchi demonstrates, proving many current supply-oriented hypotheses wrong, that the reason for the lack of industrial investment and overall growth in colonial India was not what economists had been repeating ad infinitum. That is, the lack of supply of capital, or its “shynesss”, lack of entrepreneurship, unsuitable social traditions and values in contrast to the so-called “protestant ethic” in England, overpopulation and so on, but the imposition of the priorities of British imperialism in India which constrained demand severely, limiting the profitability or even viability of investment.\nProfessor Bagchi’s foray into the economic history of the modern period led him inevitably to look at the capitalist system as a global phenomenon, which explained the development of some parts of the world and the underdevelopment if not decimation of other parts. Among his numerous publications, the next major contribution came in the form of the book The Political Economy of Underdevelopment, published in 1982. It is a study that looks at various parts of the world which became victims of colonialism at different points of time for varying periods, under different colonial masters, but all sharing certain underlying similarities and structural disabilities. The study covered Latin America, Indonesia, China and India.\nFrom here, the logical next step was his masterly overview of the emergence of world capitalism and its impact, not only in the early stages of the rise of capitalism but also its devastating consequences on a large part of humanity up to the current millennium. It was to be his last magnum opus, Perilous Passage: Mankind and the Global Ascendancy of Capital, published in 2005. In this work, Bagchi, in his inimitable polemical style backed by huge amount of empirical evidence, demolishes several Eurocentric myths promoted by the dominant Western world, such as that Europe went ahead of the rest of the world centuries before the Industrial Revolution, or that Europe shot ahead of the rest of the world with the Industrial Revolution because of some intrinsic advantages or capabilities. On the contrary, he shows that the Great Divergence, the rapid rise of the West was in fact predicated upon surplus extraction and decimation of the rest. Through a detailed calculation he shows that between 1871 and 1916, Britain extracted as tribute from India about £3.2 billion while total British investment abroad was about £4 billion, a large part of it going to the White colonies and the US. The blood and sweat of the Indian people thus contributed, in no small measure, to the “peopling of the United States” through massive migrations from Europe “and its rise as the most economically advanced country in the world (and) also helped improve the living conditions of the Europeans left behind.” A connection Professor Bagchi brings home so dramatically that our colonised minds did not make.\nMOST READ\n1\nWhy Bangladesh is not Pakistan\n2\nIt’s not easy being a woman officer.

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/brain-rot-how-gen-z-engaging-damaged-chaotic-world-inherited-9704066/",
        "content": "There is a famous song by a famous singer that often comes to mind these days. Finneas in ‘The 90s’ sings, “I think about the ’90s/ When the future was a testament/ To something beautiful and shiny, now/ We’re only counting down the time that’s left/ With everything behind me”.\nGeneration after generation, the question of inheritance comes up. A blue blood inheritance can make people, an inheritance of illness can unmake them. But most importantly, it reminds us: You came from somewhere. You are one notch in a long legacy of creation. Gen Z’s inheritance is giant technological marvels and a world that is coming apart at the seams. It is chaos. It is absurdity. Oxford University Press seems to agree. Its Word of the Year, picked after wide public discussion, is “brain rot” — as in what happens to the brain in the absence of any inconvenience, in the age of absolute access. (Think: BlinkIt, Swiggy, 5G internet, touch-screen phones that double up as movie screens) Brain rot, as in what your brain does when its job, increasingly, seems to be to just sit back and watch the computers take over. (Think: AI overviews, chatbots that can simplify complex texts, “smart” watches, TVs, fridges, homes). Brain rot, as in something that can help the brain revel in its rotting. (Think: Reality TV, doom-scrolling, meta humour)\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Brain rot” is another in a long, disjointed list of words that spell out a pattern if one pieces them together. The Chill Guy/Girl, the “this is fine” meme (while sitting inside a house on fire), and of course, bed rot, all communicate surreal disengagement. The general sentiment seems to be: “Yeah, we know it’s all gone for a toss. What about it?” Tied together with humour and heavy, sometimes concerning, levels of irony, brain rot is how this generation reckons with all things serious, for a lack of a choice. This is how it engages with its absurd inheritance — economic and global orders in collapse, life-threatening diseases on the up and up, different kinds of privacy compromised, corporate capture and a climate catastrophe to which they have front-row seats. Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, says about this year’s selection: “It demonstrates a somewhat cheeky self-awareness in the younger generations about the harmful impact of social media that they’ve inherited.” It is, in essence, like most Gen Z humour, an “in joke”. The punchline is: “We’re all gonna die”.\nBrain rot makes up part of another digital puzzle — this year, like previous ones, saw many dictionaries and platforms pick words that are attempting to capture the swell of technological changes we are living through. The runners-up for Oxford were “lore”, “demure”, “romantasy” which are all either born out of the internet age or have regained prominence and new meaning thanks to it. “Demure” is the word of the year for Dictionary.com. The anxiety of not wanting to be caught off-guard, like when Facebook and its ilk took off in the bad old Noughties, is palpable. Everybody, from governments to journalists to citizens, seems to want to take this culture apart and understand exactly what’s going on as it is going on – and what it all means. Hence, the many words of the year, all announcing the arrival of a moment we’ve been in the middle of for a quarter of a century.\nThe absurdists have it, folks. We are all hurtling towards an unknowable, probably unpleasant, oblivion. Choking on the air we are trying to breathe, alarm bell after alarm bell about the dangers of the (mis/dis)information age, and the cruelties we witness while it all goes on — there is a sour taste in the mouth, and not much hope to work with. But while the world blindly panics with hits and misses, one generation’s strategy seems to be, “this is fine”. As long as we are laughing, “this is going to be fine”. There may be a lesson in that.\nsukhmani.malik@expressindia.com"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/rbis-challenge-9702950/",
        "content": "Over the next few days, the RBI’s monetary policy committee will hold its last scheduled meeting for this calendar year. So far, the central bank’s “resilient” growth outlook provided the committee the space to keep the policy rate unchanged and focus on “attaining a durable alignment of inflation with the target”. However, since the last committee meeting in October, the macroeconomic scenario has changed dramatically — inflation has edged upwards, while growth has slowed down. In this changed environment, questions are being asked, including by the government, about whether the RBI has kept interest rates too high for too long, not anticipating the economic slowdown.\nAs reported in this paper, the government has raised questions over the stance of monetary policy, calling into question the central bank’s assessment of the underlying growth momentum and price dynamics in the country. On growth, it viewed the RBI’s exuberance — the central bank had raised its growth forecast to 7.2 per cent for the year in June — as out of sync with other signals. Thereafter, even when economic indicators subsequently pointed towards a slowing growth momentum, the central bank continued to exude confidence about the economy’s growth prospects, retaining its growth forecast in the October MPC meeting. Its assessment was also at odds with some segments of India Inc who have spoken frankly about the pain points in the economy. The economy grew at 5.4 per cent in the second quarter, compared to the RBI’s assessment of 7 per cent in the October MPC meeting. There is also disagreement with the central bank’s assessment of the underlying price pressures in the economy. The RBI is worried about the second round effects of high food inflation spilling over to core inflation. But as per government officials, there are no second round effects. Excluding gold and silver, core inflation is stable. Moreover, the surge in headline inflation over the past two months has been largely due to food inflation, which in turn is driven by vegetables. Analysts expect vegetable prices to show some moderation in the coming data.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRBI’s inflation targeting framework of 4 plus/minus 2 per cent has a degree of flexibility that gives the committee the space to look through such transient supply side shocks. Monetary policy works with long lags. With the RBI’s forecasts now showing inflation at 4.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of this financial year, and 4.3 per cent in the first quarter of next year, real interest rates remain at levels that former MPC members have characterised as excessively restrictive. The question now, after the recent GDP data, is whether the MPC will continue to attach primacy to inflation, or will growth considerations also dominate its thinking, or will the currency now also be a factor. The RBI has multiple policy tools at its disposal. It will need to draw on them as it navigates the rapidly changing environment."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/cholestrol-heart-attack-ldl-cardiology-9703342/",
        "content": "Let me tell you about the father of cardiology, Dr Eugene Braunwald. He is 95 today, has an average bad cholesterol or low density lipoprotein (LDL or a fat-protein combo that carries fat through the bloodstream but forms heart blockages in excess) count of 30 mg/dL (milligram per decilitre). He did that with drugs and lifestyle management. The optimal accepted level is 100 mg/dL, the near optimal is less than 120 mg/dL.\nWhy are we then insisting on a far lower limit? That’s because an increasing number of those who have had a heart attack are coming back to us with recurrent attacks. And that, as Dr Braunwald found, happened because LDL levels above 50 mg/dL are not good for the heart. His study showed that lowering LDL levels to around 65 mg/dL reduced the risk of death, heart attack and stroke by about 25 per cent. Braunwald also observed that patients with LDL levels lower than 40 mg/dL had an even greater reduction of risk.\nWhy do Indians need to lower their LDL?\nThat’s because Indians are genetically prone to suffering a heart attack 10 years before other populations. Apart from this, the LDL type in Indians is oxidised faster, which means they harden the walls of the arteries more rapidly. Indians have lipoprotein (a) or Lp(a), a type of LDL which can clot more easily and is harder to break down. These can stick like scum in your arteries and form blockages called plaques. If a plaque breaks in the heart artery and tears the artery wall, more blood rushes in to form a clot. In effect, the blockage grows bigger and deprives the heart of blood supply, leading to heart attacks.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat’s the safest LDL number that is required?\nInternationally, they prefer LDL levels to be less than 70 mg/dL but for Indians, I would say less than 50 mg/dL, preferably 30mg/dL. Otherwise, the risk gets compounded for Indians with additional risk factors like family history, smoking, stress, hypertension and diabetes. That’s why so many young Indians are getting a stent in early ages.\nLDL levels need to be reworked for some people with high triglycerides and body weight. Triglycerides are blood fat, which along with cholesterol, cause plaque build-up. Therefore, both triglycerides and LDL levels need to be significantly lower. In fact, LDL can be risky for post-menopause women as their cholesterol levels tend to increase with age.\nThere is no scientific evidence of lower levels of LDL being harmful to your body, so one must keep it low.\nHow to lower LDL with diet and lifestyle?\nTake the Lp(a) test, which is not part of routine medical checkups, so many people with high levels of Lp(a) don’t know they have it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo lower LDL and triglycerides with diet, you must include more fibre which binds to the cholesterol and fat and pulls them out of your body. So beans, lentils, split peas, apples, blackberries, citrus fruits, oats, oat bran are recommended. Choose healthy fats like nuts and seeds, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel or trout. You can also use olive oil instead of other fats.\nAvoid trans fats, which are found in fried foods, baked goods and some animal products. Avoid bread and pasta made from refined white flour, or cornflakes. Limit sweets and drinks with added sugar, which can raise triglycerides.\nExercise as even a modest weight loss can reduce your triglycerides, cholesterol and heart disease risk. Give up smoking and drinking altogether if you are at risk.\nWhat about medication?\nStart lipid-lowering drug therapies like statins, which lower LDL production in the liver, or ezetimibe (Zetia), which stalls absorption of LDL from the intestine, or PCSK9 inhibitors, which remove LDL from the bloodstream into the liver.\nADVERTISEMENT\n(Dr Singh is Chairman, Cardiac Sciences, Cardiology, Max Hospital, Saket)"

That’s fine. We have to continue to evolve it, and there will be continuous curation.

The car was showcased in two colours – Miami Pink in honour of Miami’s iconic architecture and London Blue, which the company says is inspired by the Opalescent Silver Blue of the 1960s Jaguar E-type.\nThe front of the car has two huge displays that can show information related to the car or used to watch content, play music and do other things. It also has an oval steering wheel, but for some reason, Jaguar has opted to remove the rear windows and the rear windshield, which is now replaced by rear cameras hidden in the sides of the body.\nJaguar says the Type 00 has a projected range of up to 430 miles, with the fast charger offering 200 miles of range in a mere 15 minutes. When it comes to looks, the Type 00 is pretty long and wide, with the edges looking like the company took inspiration from the Tesla Cybertruck.\n "

        "content": "The death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan was upheld Tuesday in Vietnam’s largest fraud case, the scale of which had raised concerns about the country’s economy.\nShe had been convicted in April of embezzlement and bribery over the fraud amounting to $12.5 billion, nearly 3% of Vietnam’s 2022 GDP. As chairperson of the Van Thinh Phat real estate firm, Lan illegally controlled Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between 2012 and 2022 and allowed 2,500 loans that cost the bank $27 billion in losses.\nThe court in Ho Chi Minh rejected her appeal against the conviction while adding that her death sentence could be commuted to life if she reimburses three-fourth of the losses, working out to around $11 billion, state media reported.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHer lawyers argued that she had repaid the money but the court disagreed since there were legal issues with some of the seized properties and prosecuting agencies couldn’t assess their value, VN Express reported.\nLan’s lawyers also noted several mitigating circumstances — she had admitted guilt, showed remorse and had paid back part of the amount. “I feel pained due to the waste of national resources,” she said last week, state media reported.But the court said her violations had negatively impacted banking, caused public disorder and eroded people’s trust, VN Express said.\nAlso Read | What to know about the real estate tycoon sentenced to death in Vietnam’s largest fraud case\nUnder Vietnamese law, death sentences aren’t immediately carried out and there is an extended legal process, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. He added that Lan would seek another review of the case or a presidential pardon to reduce her sentence.\nShe had been convicted in April of embezzlement and bribery over the fraud amounting to .5 billion, nearly 3% of Vietnam’s 2022 GDP. (Tran Quynh/VNExpress via AP)\n“Moreover, if she repays at least three-quarters of the misappropriated funds, the court may consider commuting her sentence to life imprisonment,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHer arrest was among the most high-profile in an anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that intensified after 2022. The Blazing Furnace campaign touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics. But the scale of her fraud shocked the nation with analysts raising questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred.\nThis dampened Vietnam’s economic outlook and made foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam has been trying to position itself as a home for businesses pivoting their supply chains away from China.Lan, 67, and her family had set up the Van Thing Phat company in 1992 after Vietnam shed its state-run economy in favor of a more market-oriented approach open to foreigners. The company grew into one of Vietnam’s richest real estate firms, with luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers. This made her a key player in the country’s financial industry. She orchestrated the 2011 merger of the beleaguered SCB bank with two other lenders in coordination with Vietnam’s central bank. The court said that she used this to tap SCB for cash and, according to government documents, owned more than 90% of the bank while approving thousands of loans to “ghost companies.”\nAlso Read | Explained: Vietnam’s $12 billion financial fraud, for which a businesswoman has been sentenced to death\nThese loans, according to state media, found their way to her and she bribed officials to cover her tracks.The scale of the crime meant the case was split into two trials, and Lan was sentenced to another life sentence in October. At that trial, she was accused of raising $1.2 billion from nearly 36,000 investors by issuing bonds illegally through four companies, state media reported.\nShe was also found guilty of siphoning off $18 billion obtained through fraud and for using companies controlled by her to illegally transfer more than $4.5 billion in and out of Vietnam between 2012 and 2022.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVietnam has handed down more than 2,000 death sentences in the past decade and executed more than 400 prisoners.

        "content": "Days after violence convulsed Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal over a court-ordered survey at the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid in the town, in which at least four people were killed, a local court in Rajasthan’s Ajmer admitted a petition seeking a survey at the 13th-century Ajmer Sharif Dargah. Similar petitions claiming that various other mosques or shrines were allegedly built on the sites of Hindu temples have been pending in several courts in different parts of the country. Carrying these reports over the week, the Urdu dailies expressed concerns and despair over the spike in such cases, even as they questioned the relevance of the Places of Worship Act, 1991, which bars the conversion of the religious character of a place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947 barring the Ayodhya case.\nINQUILAB\nCommenting on an Ajmer court’s move to admit a petition filed by the Hindu Sena which sought a survey at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the New Delhi edition of Inquilab, in its December 1 editorial, writes: “This fresh case reflects the same communally divisive mindset that first makes unfounded claims, then moves courts to seek surveys of various religious or cultural sites of the Muslim community in a bid to put them under suspicion.” This has been the pattern in several sites including Shahi Jama Masjid in UP’s Sambhal, Uttarkashi mosque in Uttarakhand, Gyanvapi mosque in UP, and Hubballi Idgah in Karnataka, the editorial says. “In the case of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya too, the politics of hate was built up leading to its demolition, although in 2019 the Supreme Court Constitution Bench, drawing the curtains on this dispute, handed over the site for construction of a Ram Temple.”\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has been pushing for a national population policy for a long time, cautioning that India will lose its demographic dividend in the long run. But on Sunday Bhagwat for the first time put a number to how many children Indians should have, expressing concern about the country’s falling fertility rate and advising couples to have at least three children to ensure that India’s population does not decline.\nEarlier, such remarks from Sangh leaders largely came in the context of “demographic imbalance” in terms of the allegedly rising population of Muslims vis-à-vis Hindus, and hence calling on Hindus to have more children. In that sense, Bhagwat’s remarks on Sunday, which have sparked a backlash from the Opposition, appeared to be “secular”.\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

The bypoll was necessitated by Hussain’s election to the Lok Sabha.
